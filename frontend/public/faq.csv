1,2,Q: Is it okay for a husband or wife to have an e-mail relationship with a person of the opposite sex?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1215-pub.html,"Q: Is it okay for a husband or wife to have an e-mail relationship with a person of the opposite sex? Before we specifically discuss the propriety of e-mail relationships, letâs reflect on the appropriateness of a married individual having any close relationship with someone of the opposite sex. Every day, men and women interact as classmates, co-workers, relatives, friends, and neighbors. These associations could be distant, familial, professional, or friendly, but they could also border on being flirtatious, affectionate, or intimate. In any relationship, something connects the participants. The content and context of communication between people defines the kind of relationship they have. For example, communication between co-workers is necessary to fulfill work responsibilities. This working relationship is bound within the confines of the workplace during business hours. Should colleagues decide to meet outside of the office to socialize and get to know each other, their work relationship now develops into friendship. How close and personal a relationship becomes depends on the frequency and intimacy of communication. E-mail may be an even more intimate form of communication than a telephone chat or face-to-face encounter. Voice conversations or personal meetings require on-the-fly answers to questions. Participants can judge each otherâs character with the aid of gestures and other non-verbal communication. It is considerably more difficult to mask oneâs shortcomings in person. With e-mail, however, a person has time to really think about her response to a question or reaction to a given situation. There is time to polish the message so that it can be well received by the intended reader. Behind the computer, a person can enhance his true character to appear witty, humorous, sensitive, passionate, or even flawless! Itâs no wonder we have husbands and wives leaving their families behind to pursue romance with someone theyâve found on the Internet. The risk of falling into temptation with e-mail relationships is more than most people believe. The anonymous nature of electronic messaging creates a sense of security that allows people to be bolder with their thoughts and feelings. Messages can be sent and deleted with a click of the mouse. No one can pick up the receiver and accidentally catch you conversing in a chat room. There is no paper trail, nor risk of someone intercepting a letter from the mailman. There is never the chance someone you know will spot you with that companion around town. You could carry on this virtual relationship for months, and no one ever has to know. But regardless of whether the form of communication is via telephone, letters, e-mail, or personal meetings, we have to guard our hearts and minds in Christ. We must consider the content, context, frequency, and intimacy of our communication with this person. If there is mutual pleasure and satisfaction in communicating, a few chats can become an occasion for distant acquaintances to become intimately involved. The Bible says, âCan a man take fire to his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be seared?â (Prov 6:27-28). An untamed flame will intensify into a passionate inferno if not immediately put out. As oxygen sustains fire, all relationships, whether distant or personal, require some time and communication to last. But if you feel the interaction has become too close, you must not hesitate to extinguish the relationship."
1,3,"Q: In a relationship with someone of the opposite sex outside of our marriage, how close is too close?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1216-pub.html,"Q: In a relationship with someone of the opposite sex outside of our marriage, how close is too close? It isnât always easy to determine the boundaries of communication you should have with someone who isnât your spouse. Here are three very important factors to help you draw the line: knowing your own feelings knowing the other personâs feelings knowing your spouseâs feelings. Knowing your own feelings Be careful not to deceive yourself about how you feel about your friend. A man may never confess or try hard to repress his fondness for a female crony. But a man who maintains a regular (non-professional or non-familial) association with a woman probably possesses a degree of physical attraction towards her. A woman who feels the need to speak to a male friend all of the time has most likely developed an emotional attachment to that person. In either case, if marital difficulties should develop, they often turn to their companions of the opposite sex for comfort and advice. By drawing closer to their extramarital companions, they become vulnerable to Satanâs trap. In a healthy Christian marriage, you should feel completely satisfied with the companionship you have with your spouse (Prov 5:15-19). If you often feel the need to have associations with those of the opposite sex, you should take time to examine the condition of your marriage, not run away from the issue. This desire for companions of the opposite sex likely stems from a void in your marriage. Recognize the warning signs and make a conscious effort to focus more, not less, of your attention on building your relationship with your spouse. Knowing the other personâs feelings Satan wanders about looking for every opportunity to bring people down. You may see your friend as nothing more than a brother or sister, but do not assume they feel the same way about you. He or she may even be secretively in love with you. A sad illustration of this deception is Amnonâs rape of his sister Tamar (2 Sam 13). Amnon knew it was improper for him to have relations with his virgin sister. Nevertheless, the lustful desire Satan had planted in his heart overcame him. Tamar was unaware of her brotherâs perverse feelings for her. Her good intentions and naÃ¯vetÃ© resulted in disaster, as Amnon had the opportunity to take her by force. You may believe that your friend would never have improper intentions, but Satan could work through your friend to ruin your holy matrimony. Be keen and use your God-given instinct to ward off other peopleâs amorous sentiments. Your first responsibility is to protect your marriage, even at the risk of hurting another personâs feelings. Knowing your spouseâs feelings So whatâs wrong with continuing the relationship when itâs certain that you and your friend do not have any attraction for each other? Even if your companionship may be innocent, your spouse may not be pleased. Every spouse desires their beloved to be a âgarden enclosed,â a âspring shut up,â a âfountain sealedâ (Song 4:12). Only your husband or wife should have access to your deepest thoughts and emotionsâitâs what makes a spouse special. If it seems someone else is gaining that privilege, or if your spouse feels the need to compete for your attention, then jealousy will naturally arise. You need to respect and honor your spouseâs feelings. All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful (1 Cor 6:12) in building up your marriage. We refrain from doing certain things not because the Bible explicitly forbids it, but because we love God so much that we do not want to do anything that may displease Him. Because of your love for your spouse, carefully consider if your involvement with another might cause any displeasure. Note that your spouse may not plainly express disapproval, so take the time to hear him or her out. You may be so consumed with your friend that you donât realize your spouse feels neglected. To reiterate, discontinue any extramarital relationship if 1) you begin to have amorous feelings towards your friend, 2) you feel the other person has amorous feelings for you, or 3) if you know your spouse would be displeased."
1,4,What do Jesus and God have in common?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1219-pub.html,"What do Jesus and God have in common? Jesus is with God (Jn 1:1; 14:9â10), equal with God (Jn 5:18; 10:30), sharing Godâs authority (Jn 5:27; Mt 28:18), Godâs glory (Jn 17:5), honor (Jn 5:23), work (Jn 5:17, 19) and righteousness (2 Pet 1:1). Jesus lives with God (Rev 1:17â18; Jn 6:57) and shares His holiness (Lk 1:35)."
1,5,"The Lord Jesus is the author of salvation, not the church, so if I don't go to church, as long as I believe in the Lord Jesus and follow the correct path to salvation, won't I be saved?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1220-pub.html,"The Lord Jesus is the author of salvation, not the church, so if I donât go to church, as long as I believe in the Lord Jesus and follow the correct path to salvation, wonât I be saved? The church is the body of Christ (Eph 1:22-23, 4:12, 5:23; Col 1:24). How can a person believe in Christ yet refuse to be a member of the body of Christ? True believers of Jesus Christ are members of the same body, i.e. the church (1Cor 12:12-13, 27-28). There is no doubt that Jesus is the author of salvation, but the Lord Jesus imparts his salvation through his church by sending his workers and giving his church the authority and power to forgive sins (Jn 20:21-23; Mt 16:18-19). Baptism, footwashing, Holy Communion, all of which have to do with believersâ salvation are performed by the church. A person must also pray for the Holy Spirit in the true church. Furthermore, the Lord is the savior of the church as a whole (Eph 5:23-27; see also Acts 20:28). Believers are not saved apart from the church. While those who have been purchased by the blood of Jesus are already members of the church (Acts 20:28), it is necessary that the members stay in fellowship with one another in the Lord (see Acts 2:42-47). Church services are held for members to worship together (see Mt 18:20; Heb 12:22-24); to encourage one another (Heb 10:24-25; see 1Cor 14:3-4); to pray together (Mt 18:19-20, see Acts 1:14; 2:42; 4:23-31; 12:5,12); to edify one another with spiritual gifts (Eph 4:11-12,16), so that the body of Christ may be built up to become the dwelling of Godâs Spirit (Eph 2:19-22) and be prepared as the bride of Christ (Rev 19:7; 21:2)."
1,6,What about the Big Bang Theory?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1221-pub.html,"What about the Big Bang Theory? The Big Bang theory doesnât tell us what or who caused the Big Bang because such questions are beyond the realm of natural science. If anything, the model points out that the universe is not eternal and provides strong support that there is indeed a creator. Although the name ""Big Bang"" seems to suggest that the universe resulted from chaos and blind chance, the theory in fact makes no such implication. Some have even proposed a better name for the Big Bang model, such as ""the Grand Opening,"" that would more accurately represent the awesome origin of the universe."
1,7,What is God's intention and promise for humankind?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1222-pub.html,"What is Godâs intention and promise for humankind? God predestined his chosen people to be his children (Eph 1:5; Jn 1:12â13). He promised us eternal life (1 Jn 2:25), which was promised before time began (Tit 1:2). As Godâs children, we are heirs having the hope of eternal life (Tit 3:7) and co-heirs with Christ (Rom 8:17). Godâs intention is for us to receive the eternal inheritance he keeps for us in heaven (1 Pet 1:3â4). In short, Godâs intention for us is for good. It is unfortunate so many people donât understand Godâs wonderful intention towards all people. We often continue living without even acknowledging Godâs existence, but as a result we lose out on Godâs plan of redemption and his blessing."
1,8,Didn't Paul tell believers in Corinth to make offerings on the first day of the week (1 Cor 16:2)?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1223-pub.html,"Didnât Paul tell believers in Corinth to make offerings on the first day of the week (1 Cor 16:2)? Some imagine this verse describes Sunday services where the congregation drops their offerings in the collection box when it is passed around. But Paul is not telling the members to have worship services on the first day of the week and at the same time make offerings. The collection was for the brethren in Jerusalem that were experiencing famine (1 Cor 16:3; Acts 11:27-30). Paulâs instruction to the Corinthian church to âlay something asideâ was to facilitate collection when he came. The first day of the week is the day after the Sabbath, the day when they could start working and collecting the food. Itâs also quite possible that he wanted the believers to set aside the donation at the beginning of the week so that it would not be consumed during the rest of the week."
1,9,How do I know the resurrection of Jesus really happened?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1224-pub.html,"How do I know the resurrection of Jesus really happened? p>Jesusâ death is confirmed: the Roman soldiers saw that He had died, and it is impossible He could have survived the final stab in His side (Jn 19:33-34). His body was buried behind a stone and guarded by Roman soldiers, and yet on the third day the tomb was discovered empty (Mt 28:1-8). Either Jesus resurrected, or His body was stolen. But who, other than the disciples, would want to steal the body? Those who were against Jesus could have proven that the resurrection was a hoax simply by trotting out His body from the tomb. They did not, because they could not. Jesusâ resurrection is a fact established by Paulâs own testimony, the witness of other apostles, as well as the witness of over 500 hundred other believers. It is incredible to suppose that they would suffer and die for a lie they had created. They had neither the means to pull off the fraud, nor the motive to promote it, given the immense hostility they faced. Lastly, we know He resurrected and lives today through tangible evidence: We receive the Holy Spirit, just as the apostles did in Acts, and He answers our prayers, even in miraculous ways (see testimonies )."
1,10,Who witnessed the Holy Spirit descend upon Jesus?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1225-pub.html,"Who witnessed the Holy Spirit descend upon Jesus? John the Baptist testified, âI saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him â¦ I have seen and testified that this is the Son of Godâ (Jn 1:32, 34). âBehold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!â (Jn 1:29)."
1,11,"Are we saved by these two dimensions of grace (as mentioned in ""What are the two dimensions of salvation?"")?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1226-pub.html,"Are we saved by these two dimensions of grace (as mentioned in ""What are the two dimensions of salvation?"")? Yes. The two dimensions can be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Like receiving grace upon grace or blessing upon blessing (Jn 1:16), forgiveness of sins and the gift of life are blessings in succession. So the Bible poignantly asks, âHow shall we escape [judgment] if we neglect such a great salvation?â (Heb 2:3)."
1,12,When did the Holy Spirit start working in the world?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1227-pub.html,"When did the Holy Spirit start working in the world? Genesis, the first book in the Bible, says Godâs Spirit hovered over the waters (Gen 1:2). Godâs Spirit is intimately connected to the work of creation. When God sent his Spirit, they (bugs, birds, fish, animals, etc.) were created (Ps 104:30). âBy His Spirit He adorned the heavensâ (Job 26:13). âThe Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me lifeâ (Job 33:4). In the Old Testament times, the Holy Spirit would often inspire and work in prophets and righteous people. These people would speak Godâs word, predict the future, or performed miracles on Godâs behalf, a work of the Spirit (Judg 15:14; 1 Sam 16:13). Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, who guided Jesus and moved him in his ministry. God gave Jesus the Holy Spirit without limit (Lk 4:18; Jn 3:34). Ten days after Jesus ascended to heaven, on the day of Pentecost, a Jewish feast, the Holy Spirit descended on Jesusâ followers and began to work in the church (Acts 2:1â4)."
1,13,Is there a specific language we should use in prayer?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1228-pub.html,"Is there a specific language we should use in prayer? There is no specific language, but we should note that there is something called spiritual tongues in prayer. Paul once said of prayer in the spirit: âI will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understandingâ (1 Cor 14:15). Here, Paul is speaking of two types of language we use in prayer. First, âpray with the spiritâ means praying in the Holy Spirit or praying with spiritual tongues. How do we know? We know from 1 Corinthians 14:14, where Paul says, âFor if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays...â We can think of prayer in spiritual tongues as a type of spiritual language we speak after we receive the Holy Spirit. If you are confused about spiritual tongues, please refer to the questions related to the Holy Spirit. But apostle Paul also mentions âpraying with the mind,â which means praying in a language we ourselves can understand. When we pray in the spirit, we will not understand what is being said, even though we ourselves are praying in a spiritual tongue, for we are speaking mysteries in the spirit, which only God understands without translation (1 Cor 14:2). However, even when we pray in the spirit, we can also pray with our mind, i.e., to pray to God in a language we understand. So, for example, if we speak English and we are praying in spiritual tongues, we can still pray to God, in our mind, in English. We reach out and speak to God with our mind in prayer, even though we are praying in a spiritual tongue. The Bible teaches us that we do not have to use many words to have our prayer heard by God; rather, God already knows what our needs are (Mt 6:7â8). Since God already knows our needs in prayer, prayer in the Holy Spirit is often the deepest type of prayer, for the Holy Spirit himself can intercede for us in our weaknesses (Rom 8:26). But what should we say in our mind? What language should we use? Just continually repeat the Lordâs Prayer in our head? No. We should often give thanks and praise to God. We do not have to make a long list of our requests to God, which is not to say we can never petition God in prayer. But we must take care of our motives in prayer. Thanksgiving and praise are most effective in prayer. In Revelation 19:1â6, the people of heaven, the elders, and the four living creatures all shouted âHallelujahâ to praise God. The voice of the many people in heaven sounded like the roar of rushing waters. Jesus tells us that the Holy Spirit is like a flow of living water coming out of our hearts (Jn 7:38). Acts 2:2 describes the Holy Spiritâs downpour as the sound of a rushing mighty wind. The church filled with the Holy Spirit, when praying in the Spirit, will sound like the roar of rushing waters. A spiritual church should always have the sound of Godâs praise resounding within the church."
1,14,What about the theory of evolution?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1229-pub.html,"What about the theory of evolution? The Darwinian theory of random mutation and natural selection still depends on some kind of pre-existing order. Evolution may describe a process of creation, and scientists may successfully use its principles to manipulate or clone creatures. It cannot, however, explain away the first cause. Even if the theory of evolution is correct, it still does not rule out a creator: Creation is an actâthe act of an agent, in this case God. Evolution is a process. A description of the processes of creation is not a logical alternative to the act of creation, as Darwin himself realizedâ¦. Nobody would claim that understanding the mechanisms of an invention ruled out an inventor. Yet a similar claim is made that understanding the mechanisms of creation rules out a Creator. (Michael Poole, A Guide to Science and Belief [Oxford, Lion Publishing, 1990], 110)"
1,15,What should believers pray for?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1230-pub.html,"What should believers pray for? âBe anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to Godâ (Phil 4:6). The âeverythingâ in this verse refers to every matter or circumstance. So in every matter and in every circumstance we must allow God to guide our life. Only then, in trusting God, can we relieve our anxiety in life and receive Godâs peace. Peace is such a precious commodity, but we often fail to recognize Godâs peace often begins with a simple prayer."
1,16,"Don't Christians worship on Sunday to honor the first day of the week, the day Christ resurrected?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1231-pub.html,"Donât Christians worship on Sunday to honor the first day of the week, the day Christ resurrected? Nowhere in the Bible does it record that Jesus Christ replaced the seventh-day Sabbath with the first day of the week as a day of worship. Jesus did not instruct the disciples to worship on the first day of the week instead of the Sabbath. We keep the Sabbath as a reminder of how God has delivered us from sin (Eze 20:12). It also signifies our future eternal rest (Heb 4:9-11). Some commentators conjecture that the mention of the Lordâs Day (Rev 1:10) refers to the observance of Christâs resurrection on the first day of the week. Neither John nor any other New Testament writer confirms this; nor does the Bible command worship on the first day of the week. We cannot interpret the Bible based on what a certain event signifies, especially when the interpretation contradicts the commandment of God."
1,18,"Don't good works show that a person is already saved? If sacraments are required for salvation, then how do you explain the good works of Christians who have never received the sacraments?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1233-pub.html,"Donât good works show that a person is already saved? If sacraments are required for salvation, then how do you explain the good works of Christians who have never received the sacraments? A person could perform good works without faith in Jesus Christ. So good works cannot be a sign of a person â s salvation. Cornelius â s good works were not enough. He still needed to hear the gospel, repent and be baptized to receive eternal life (Acts 10:1-47; 11:18). The sacraments are fundamental to our covenantal relationship with God. Without them, all subsequent works of faith would amount to nothing. Unless a person is baptized into Christ, he still stands condemned because he is still in sin. Unless his feet are washed by Christ, he still has no part with Christ. Unless he partakes of the Lord â s body and blood, he does not have life in him. The good works that he performs may seem to assure him that he is an elect of God, but these good works would not be much different from the works of the law because he has not received the righteousness of Christ."
1,19,Is there a proper form or attitude we should have in prayer?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1234-pub.html,"Is there a proper form or attitude we should have in prayer? There is really no set formula in our prayer. However, when we pray, our heart, body, and mind should be in one accord (one unity). That is, we should fully devote our focus on God. Our prayers are like holy sacrifices offered to our Lord and Master, so in worshipping God, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted by worldly concerns. Rather, we should devote ourselves fully in prayer (Acts 6:4). Jesus said, âGod is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truthâ (Jn 4:24). While praying, we may sit or stand (2 Sam 7:18; Jer 18:20), kneel (Acts 20:36), lie prostrate (Mt 26:39), lift up our hands (1 Tim 2:8), look up to heaven (Jn 11:41), cry out in a loud voice (Ezek 11:13; Acts 4:24), pray silently (1 Sam 1:13), shed tears (Heb 5:7), beat our breast (Lk 18:13), and rejoice in the spirit (Lk 10:21; Job 22:26). Whatever our form of prayer, we should always be sensitive to the guidance of Godâs Holy Spirit and purpose. We should not lay down any fixed pattern for prayer. However, we should not deny the fact that speaking in tongues is essential evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. Prayer in the Holy Spirit is good and should not be forbidden. In fact, we must receive the Holy Spirit for our salvation (Jn 3:5; Tit 3:5). What we must be careful to avoid in laying down biblical guidelines on prayer forms is to turn prayer into a ritualistic formula. Prayer is not mathematics, so we do not follow some set formula or repetition of creeds. We should not chant things without purpose in our prayers. Prayers come from the heart and spirit, so we must pray with sincerity and truth (Mt 6:5). If we pray with the wrong motivation or attitude, we may well leave a foothold for Satan to work within us."
1,20,Why do you not consider the Apocrypha as part of the Scripture?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1235-pub.html,"Why do you not consider the Apocrypha as part of the Scripture? The Pharisees and other religious authorities did not include them in the Hebrew Old Testament canon. Neither the Jews, Jesus, nor any New Testament writer quoted it as the Word of God. Josephus, the great Jewish historian, and Philo, the Jewish philosopher, excluded it. The early church fathers excluded it. The Bible translator Jerome did not accept the books as inspired, although the Pope forced him to include them in the Latin Vulgate Bible. None of the books claims divine inspiration; in fact, some actually disclaim it. Some apocryphal books contain historical, geographical and doctrinal errors."
1,21,What happened after Jesus died?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1236-pub.html,"What happened after Jesus died? He was buried for three days and then resurrected from the dead (Mt 28:6). By resurrecting from the dead, Jesus fulfilled his own prophecy to his disciples that he would rise on the third day (Mt 16:21; 17:22; Mk 8:31; Lk 9:22; 18:33)."
1,22,"Why does it matter how a person is baptized? And if I've already been baptized in another church, must I be baptized again?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1237-pub.html,"Why does it matter how a person is baptized? And if Iâve already been baptized in another church, must I be baptized again? The definition of baptism already denotes how and where one should be baptized: immersion in living water. If done otherwise, the action could not be called baptism, nor would it carry any effect to cleanse sins. The baptism of salvation has spiritual power to cleanse sins. This baptism is thus different from the traditional ablution of the Jews or proselyte baptism. A person receiving baptism of salvation is baptized into Christ, in the name of Jesus Christ, who forgives sins through baptism (Gal 3:27; Acts 2:38). The spiritual effect of baptism in the likeness of Jesusâ death is the death and burial of oneâs old self and the resurrection of a new person (Rom 6:3-5; Col 2:12). Baptism is not simply following a ritual. Ephesians 4:5 points out that there is âone Lord, one faith, one baptism.â All true believers of Jesus Christ must believe in the same Lord, hold the same faith, and receive the same baptism. Itâs important to know what the Bible says about how one should be baptized, and to follow the example the Lord Jesus and the disciples set for believers to follow."
1,23,"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people, and the wicked to   prosper?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1238-pub.html,"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people, and the wicked to prosper? When Jesusâ disciples asked why the man He healed was born blind, He replied, &amp;quot;Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him&amp;quot; (Jn 9:3). God allows even those He loves to suffer, because suffering ultimately reveals to us Godâs sovereign power. Through suffering, we come to realize our limitations and learn to turn instead to Him. Thus, God allows suffering for our own good, so that in the end, ""the genuineness of [our] faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ"" (1 Pet 1:7). We come to doubt in God when we try to fit Him into our view of what is right. To our eyes, focused on the present and visible, the wicked may seem to prosper. But we fail to realize the spiritual reality that those who do not have God live in darkness and nakedness, even though they may materially prosper. We also forget that the things of this life are only temporaryâthat we cannot see the full consequences of eternity today."
1,24,How can we be sure that the seventh day today is the original seventh day God set aside in the beginning? What if we've lost track of time?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1239-pub.html,"How can we be sure that the seventh day today is the original seventh day God set aside in the beginning? What if weâve lost track of time? The Lord Jesus observed the Sabbath day (Lk 4:16; 13:10; Mk 6:2). So it should be beyond doubt that the day had not been lost up to Jesusâ time. The apostles confirmed the Sabbath kept by the Jews (Acts 15:21). Paul himself also kept the Sabbath (Acts 13:13-14; 16:13; 17:1-2; 18:4). During the same period, sun worshippers observed Sunday and Sunday worship was later brought into the church. Yet the Jews were still keeping the Sabbath (seventh day). Both practices have been observed until today. Although the Jews have been dispersed to different parts of the world, they have all been keeping the Sabbath on the same day even until today. The seven-day week is found in many countries worldwide since ancient times. The days are the same from country to country. God, the creator of the Sabbath as well as the universe, would not have allowed His sacred day to be lost."

God is perfectâperfectly good but also perfectly loving. One who is perfectly good cannot stand anything that is not good. Even humans, who are imperfect, display this in their nature. If this were strictly how God operated, none of would be alive today. As imperfect creatures, we should all be destroyed. But because of His mercy, God gives us a chance to be redeemed. If we choose to accept His grace and rely on Jesus Christ, then He will clothe us with the perfection of Jesus Christ. That is how much God loves us, and wants us to be saved. But if we choose to reject His grace, then we will only receive what we deserve. We are the ones who make the choice to live without God. In doing so, we choose hell, because hell is eternal separation from God, His love, and His joy."
1,26,How do we know that the universe didn't always exist?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1241-pub.html,"How do we know that the universe didnât always exist? According to the second law of thermodynamics, the amount of usable energy in the universe is decreasing. The universe does not have an infinite quantity of energy. Since everything that is finite must have a beginning, the universe did not always exist. The premise that the universe had a beginning receives strong support from natural science. Science has shown that the universe is steadily expanding: therefore, at some point in the distant past, it came into being. The Big Bang theory, supported by the discovery of a radiation echo in the universe, points out that the universe is not eternal, but had a beginning from a single source. Finally, we observe that all matter changes and is not eternal. Therefore the universe cannot be eternal."
1,27,"Since there is no scientific evidence for heaven, how do we know it's real, and not just wishful thinking and human invention?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1242-pub.html,"Since there is no scientific evidence for heaven, how do we know itâs real, and not just wishful thinking and human invention? Not everything can be proven with methods known to science today. For example, can you show someone your love with scientific evidence? Since our scientific knowledge is limited, we cannot use it as the ultimate authority. Is there any scientific evidence that proves the assumption that whatever cannot be proven by science does not exist? If even this assumption cannot be proven by science, why do you believe it? To find out whether heaven is real, we need to find out whether the Bible and Jesus are true because they both teach us about heaven. If the Bible is indeed God's word and if Jesus is indeed Lord and Savior, then heaven must be real. We know that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead because He answers our prayers and pours out His Holy Spirit as He has promised (Question 3.3). Since we know that Christ has risen and gone to heaven, we know that heaven is real. The argument that heaven does not exist because we want it so much is fallacious. If this reasoning is true, it could work the other way, too (i.e. because you donât want heaven to exist, heaven must be real because your wishful thinking has to be false). To refute an idea, we should provide solid evidence instead of simply calling it wishful thinking."
1,28,Didn't the disciples in Troas worship and have Holy Communion with Paul on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7)?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1243-pub.html,"Didnât the disciples in Troas worship and have Holy Communion with Paul on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7)? The Biblical day begins in the evening (Gen 1:5,8,13). On that occasion the disciples had met on Saturday evening, not Sunday. The terminology âto break bread,â when used in isolation, does not necessarily refer to Holy Communion, which always includes âthe cup of blessingâ (1 Cor 10:16; 11:23-29; Mt 26:26-29). Breaking of bread can refer to a daily meal or fellowship meal (Acts 2:46; 27:35-36). Acts 20:7-8 describes a farewell meal for Paul who was walking to Assos the next day (Acts 20:13-14). There was no Sunday service at all."
1,29,Is the Lord's Prayer the only prayer we should use in the church?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1244-pub.html,"Is the Lordâs Prayer the only prayer we should use in the church? The Lordâs Prayer functions to teach us how and what to pray for. The Lordâs Prayer shows us the basic principles of prayer to God and inspires us in prayer. However, we can be more flexible in our prayers than simply reciting the Lordâs Prayer. If we merely followed the form of the Lordâs Prayer, it could very well become ritualistic prayer, which would merely decorate our worship. Ritualistic prayer runs counter to the Lordâs teaching. Since we often do not know how to pray, the Lord taught us basic principles and elements in the Lordâs Prayer. We learn a lot from the Lordâs Prayer. At the same time, we often can pray in the Spirit to get deeper into prayer (remember prayer in spiritual tongues is synonymous with prayer in the Spirit). The Holy Spirit can intercede for us according to Godâs purpose when we feel weak (Rom 8:26â27)."
1,30,What is the difference between salvation and a Savior?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1245-pub.html,"What is the difference between salvation and a Savior? Obviously, the Savior is the one who accomplishes salvation. The Lord Jesus is the only one God, who came in the flesh, to save all humanity. Salvation is what Jesus Christ, the Savior, accomplished through giving himself up for our sins. Our Lord Jesus took the place of our condemnation in sin in order to save us from sin and death (2 Cor 5:21). Therefore, the Bible says, âSalvation is by grace.â Only through the Lord Jesusâ grace can we be saved (Acts 15:11)."
1,31,What is prayer?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1246-pub.html,"What is prayer? In its most general definition, prayer can be seen as any direct communion and communication between ourselves and God. Prayer is a way to call upon God (Ps 141:2; Rom 10:12â13). A lot of prayers in the Bible are intercessory prayers, which is often related to Godâs judgment of othersâ sins (1 Sam 2:25; Jer 15:1). Prayer can be in the form of hymns or psalms (Ps 72:20) or a prayer may simply be a written composition (e.g., the Lordâs Prayer; Mt 6:9ff). Viewed broadly, prayer can even be a non-verbal communication with God, for instance, in sacrifice, dance, or body gestures. But in the end, prayer aims to deepen our relationship with God. In prayer, we hope we can receive Godâs blessing, guidance, mercy, and justice (judgment)."
1,32,Isn't there biblical basis for baptism for the dead (1 Cor 15:29)?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1247-pub.html,"Isn't there biblical basis for baptism for the dead (1 Cor 15:29)? This passage does not command baptism for the dead nor make any judgment about such practice. Paul asked the question, &amp;quot;Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?&amp;quot; (1 Cor 15:29). His point was not that such practice was necessarily correct, but that such practice demonstrated peopleâs belief in the resurrection. Paul could not have endorsed vicarious baptism (the living being baptized on behalf of the dead) because it is against Biblical teaching for several reasons: Baptism is for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 22:16). Since all have sinned (Rom 3:23), everyone must be baptized for the forgiveness of his own sins (Acts 2:38). No one may be baptized for the forgiveness of anotherâs sins. Baptism is not merely a formality or an immersion of the body; it is a spiritual cleansing and salvation of the soul (1Pet 3:21; Heb 9:14). Once a person dies, the soul leaves his body. Baptizing a living person on behalf of the dead cannot in any way save the soul of the dead. After a person dies, he is to face judgment (Heb 9:27). Those who had failed to believe in the Lord will be condemned (Mk 16:16; Rev 21:8), and every person will be judged according to what he had done (Rev 20:12). So once a person dies, he has to give an account of his disbelief and no one else may receive salvation on behalf of him. This verse may refer to baptism of family members for the sake of a Christian member who has passed away and had expressed the wish before death that his/her family believe in the Lord Jesus and be baptized."
1,33,Is it necessary to receive the Holy Spirit?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1248-pub.html,Is it necessary to receive the Holy Spirit? Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ (the Holy Spirit) does not belong to Christ (Rom 8:9). The Holy Spirit also testifies that we are the children and heirs of God (Rom 8:15-17; Gal 4:6-7). He is the seal of our future inheritance (Eph 1:13-14).
1,34,Was Jesus born on December 25?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1249-pub.html,"Was Jesus born on December 25? The December 25th celebration of Christmas was instituted by the Catholic Church. Christmas originated from a pagan festival that celebrated the winter solstice. The winter solstice marked the first day the sun seemed to intensify. So from the winter solstice onward, as the nights became shorter and the day longer, pagans would have grand ceremonies in honor of the sun god. The worship of the sun was customary in ancient Rome. The Catholic Church adopted Emperor Constantineâs suggestion that pagan customs be Christianized, to allow ease of conversion to pagan converts, i.e., making them feel âat homeâ as Christians. Pagans regarded Christ as the great sun of the human spirit, so they chose December 25th to celebrate Jesusâ birth."
1,35,"When did Jesus start to preach? How did Jesus"" service to the people begin?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1250-pub.html,"When did Jesus start to preach? How did Jesusâ service to the people begin? Jesus began His ministry when He was thirty (Lk 3:23). A prophet named John was sent by God to prepare the way for Jesus. John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance and pointed his disciples to the one who would come after Him and had greater power (Mt 3:1, 11). John said, âHe must increase, but I must decreaseâ (Jn 3:30). Many of Johnâs disciples left John and followed Jesus."
1,36,How can God be so narrow-minded as to save only one church and reject all those others who love Him deeply?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1251-pub.html,"How can God be so narrow-minded as to save only one church and reject all those others who love Him deeply? It is not God who is narrow-minded, but those who do not accept His gospel. If God were to accept everyone regardless of whether they obey him, He would not be the just God that He is, and His words would mean nothing at all. The Lord said, âIf anyone loves Me, he will keep My wordâ (Jn 14:23; cf. 1 Jn 5:3). If someone claims to love God but refuses to obey Him, his claim is false. God knows who truly loves Him (1 Cor 8:3). If a person never hears of the true gospel in his lifetime, it is God who will ultimately determine whether he was a true believer. But as for us who have already known the true gospel, it is our responsibility to accept and obey it."

Despite the fact that footwashing is found only in the Gospel according to John, it is still to be kept and its relationship to salvation is still valid. All of the Lord's commandments need to be kept. Not a single commandment should be neglected regardless of how many times they are being mentioned in the Bible (see Mt 5:18-19; Rev 22:19). The Lord instructed his followers to perform footwashing as He had done for His disciples; therefore, we also need to keep this commandment."
1,38,Why do people pray?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1253-pub.html,"Why do people pray? The desire and need to pray is often said to differentiate people from animals. We might say prayer lies at the heart of human nature, for people seem to have a need to reach out to God, especially in times of distress and trials. Human beings have limitations to their power, for we understand we do not have ultimate authority to direct our destiny; naturally, we often reach out to God when we have exhausted our own resources. The âinstinct to prayâ can be seen as the remnant of humanityâs intimate relationship with God in the past. Yet because of the First Parentâs sin, humanityâs relationship with God was hampered. We often call this hampering of our relationship with God, which was caused by sin, as the âfallâ of humanity. Ever since the fall, people have been seeking a way to go back to God (Gen 4:26). However, ever since our relationship with God was âcut offâ from the fall, people have been prone to seek their own ways to the divine. Many religions, even today, worship something in Godâs creation; for humanity has forgotten its Creator. Idols, statues, and figurines are often popular substitutes for God (Rev 9:20; Rom 1:23), and people will often pray to false gods (1 Kgs 18:26). But we should abandon our idols and return to the one true God. In modern society, many people have forgotten Godâs existence altogether. Atheists will neither give God glory nor gratitude, for they do not know how to call upon him (Ps 14:4). To disbelieve in God, the Creator of all things, is truly foolish and rebellious; yet, Godâs will and time is always present in all things. It may please God to keep his spiritual truth hidden from the proud (Mt 11:25; 1 Cor 2:6ff). Pride is a reason why many people do not pray, even though we are so insignificant. Even though we cannot even control our own destiny, we often feel like we are beyond Godâs reach. So we often think, âWhy should I pray? Whatâs that going to change?â We must not be proud in prayer, we should humbly cry out to God so he will hear us (Ps 77:1). The Bible tells us to call on God and he will save us (Ps 55:16)."
1,39,How do I know the Bible has not been changed over the years?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1254-pub.html,"How do I know the Bible has not been changed over the years? To test the reliability of historical documents, historians examine the textual transmissions by which the documents reach us. They look at the number of manuscripts (copies), the consistency among manuscripts, and the time interval between the composition of the original work and the date of the earliest extant manuscripts. They can then determine the accuracy of the transmission. A vast number of biblical manuscripts have been discovered over time. Besides the great number of manuscripts, the fact that these biblical manuscripts agree with each other assures us that the Bible has not been altered over time. It is important to keep in mind that the ancient Hebrews regarded the Scripture as sacred text. Copyists, therefore, took extreme care in copying and storing the manuscripts. As a result, the manuscripts we have today are not casual copies, but faithful transmissions of the divine Word."
1,40,"Besides faith, what else does the Bible say we need to receive a complete salvation?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1255-pub.html,"Besides faith, what else does the Bible say we need to receive a complete salvation? The Bible often mentions returning to God in repentance when we are under sin (Acts 20:21). God himself commands people everywhere to repent (Acts 17:30). Repentance means turning back from our wrong and evil ways (Jas 5:20; Acts 3:26). We need an attitude of repentance when we come to believe. We could say that faith in God leads to repentance. It will be difficult for you to repent if you donât have a deep trust, belief, or obedience toward God. To repent effectively, we must be inspired by the truth of grace and confess our sins before God (Lk 19:8â9). True repentance means we turn from our life of sin, which means our thoughts and behavior must change or turn (Lk 3:8). Without true repentance, mere lip-service or confessing the Lord with our mouths alone does nobody any good. If our belief in God is going to be superficial, then we might as well not believe. A believer who does not approach Godâs grace with a correct faith has no share in the truth, just like apostle Peter told Simon the sorcerer he had no part with the grace of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:9â24)."
1,41,What are sacraments?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1256-pub.html,"What are sacraments? &amp;quot;Sacraments&amp;quot; 1 is a term that refers to three New Testament institutions: baptism, footwashing, and Holy Communion. These three sacraments are instituted by the Lord Jesus and commanded to his followers (Mark 16:16; John 13:1-7; Matthew 26-29). The sacraments all involve the use of physical elements or actions. According to the Lord's promise, the sacraments have the effect of salvation. In baptism, the effect of remission of sins takes place when the believer is immersed in water in the name of Jesus Christ. In footwashing, the believer has a part with the Lord by accepting the washing of feet in water. In Holy Communion, the believer partakes of the eternal life of Jesus Christ. The sacraments signify the believer's covenantal relationship with the Lord and mark the beginning of regeneration. 1. In both Catholic and Reform theology, the word &amp;quot;sacrament&amp;quot; refers to the Christian rites, such as baptism and the Lord's Supper. Tertullian was the first to employ the word sacramentum , the Latin version of the New Testament term &amp;quot;mystery&amp;quot; (see Ephesians 5:32; 1 Timothy 3:16; Revelation 1:20). The use of this word to refer to the New Testament divine institutions may be due to the spiritual effect, which we cannot rationalize."

God knew long ago that the earth was a sphere and that there would be time differences. God would not give a commandment that is impossible to follow. We simply keep the Sabbath day from sunset to sunset (or the corresponding hours) at our own locale. It this objection to keeping the Sabbath were to hold, then it would also be impossible for Sunday worshippers to decide which time zone would be standard to mark the first day of the week."
1,43,What is God's place in the universe?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1258-pub.html,"What is God's place in the universe? God rules the universe and all that is in it (Acts 17:24). âThe earth is the LORD's, and all its fullness, The world and those who dwell therein. â (Ps 24:1). God is the heavenly Father of all humankind (Mal 2:10; Mt 23:9), who is above all and through all and in all (Eph 4:6). From Him, through Him, and to Him belong all things. And to God alone will the glory be forever! (Rom 11:36). All these references to the Bible above make it clear: Godâs position is the highest, higher than the leader of the free world. God rules the universe and everything in it."

As members of the body of Christ, we need to stay in fellowship with one another in the Lord (see Acts 2:42-47). Church services are held for members: To worship together (see Mt 18:20; Heb 12:22-24); To encourage one another (Heb 10:24-25; see 1 Cor 14:3-4); To pray together (Mt 18:19-20, see Acts 1:14; 2:42; 4:23-31; 12:5,12); and To edify one another with spiritual gifts (Eph 4:12-16), so the body of Christ may be built up to become the dwelling place of Godâs Spirit (Eph 2:19-22). Without the support of other members, we may falter in our faith and lose our way. By not coming to church, we also lose the opportunity to serve the Lord in the ways He has commanded us. The Lord Jesus promises us that âwhere two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of themâ (Mt 18:20). When we worship Him together through songs and prayer, study His word through sermons and discussions, and serve and love one another, He will bless us and be with us."

1,49,"How can we pray with the utmost sincerity, earnestness, and effectiveness?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1264-pub.html,"How can we pray with the utmost sincerity, earnestness, and effectiveness? The Lord often mentioned fasting prayer when faced with difficult situations. So when we encounter great difficulties and feel our prayers are not being heard, we should humble ourselves, fast, and pray (Ps 35:13). Fasting prayer is a form of denial of the flesh. But if we fast without a proper heart, our fast is useless (Mt 6:16â18). We should never fast just for the sake of afflicting our body. We deny our flesh to show our sincerity and desire for Godâs blessing. Fasting also expresses our devotion to God. After Jesus was baptized, he fasted forty nights and days in the desert. Jesus was preparing for his ministry, but he was also preparing himself to overcome the temptations of the flesh and of Satan. We often think Jesus was superhuman, for Jesus always seemed to triumph over temptation. But do you want to know the secret? Jesus never gave into the flesh, but continued in fasting and prayer. On the other hand, Eve, being tempted by the forbidden fruit, ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, while Jesus fasted forty days and nights! Eveâs indulgence in the flesh, a seemingly minor slip, caused humankind a lasting sorrow. If we can learn to fast, we will add strength to our prayers and overcome our fleshly desires."

We are all born of Adam and Eveâthey were our first parents. Therefore the Bible says we are conceived in sin (Ps 51:5). Even through we originate from our parents, we are all descended from Adam and Eve. Adam carried all of humanity within himself, like an oak tree that holds an oak table within itself. When Adam sinned, he brought sin and death into the world, and every descendant of Adam exists in that fallen state. Death brought forth death, just as an oak tree produces an oak table. We wouldnât expect an oak tree to produce a plastic table. Neither do we expect an orange tree to bear apples. Therefore Romans 5:12 tells us that âthrough one man sin entered the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.â Physical death is our fate, for we are all destined to die (Heb 9:27). And unless we are spiritually reborn (Jn 3:5), we will face the lake of fire (Rev 20:14)."

We pray to glorify God (Jn 12:28) and seek after Godâs will (Lk 22:42). We can pray to God about everything, but we must never pray against Godâs will or his glory. God wants us to ask for his will through prayerâto seek after him. Like any love in life, we all want to seek after our love and be sought after and loved ourselves. We cannot receive Godâs will unless we first ask him for it. However, if we ask amiss, i.e., against Godâs will, we will not receive it even if we continue to ask God for it (Jas 4:2â3). The Bible tells us of many things, relating to Godâs will, that we can pray for:&amp;nbsp; 1) Pray for the church:&amp;nbsp; Ask the Lord to send out workers (Mt 9:38) Pray that God may open a door for the gospel, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ (Col 4:3) Pray for given words that we may fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel (Eph 6:19â20) Pray that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored (2 Thess 3:1) Pray for God to renew our days (Lam 5:21) Pray for the Lord to stretch out his hand and perform miraculous signs and wonders (Acts 4:30) Pray for believers that they may receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:14â15) 2) Pray for our spiritual life:&amp;nbsp; Pray and ask for the Holy Spirit (Lk 11:13; Jn 4:10; 7:38â39)&amp;nbsp; Ask the Lord to teach us his way (Ps 86:11; Jn 14:26; 1 Cor 2:13)&amp;nbsp; Ask God to strengthen us, in our inner being, with power through his Spirit (Eph 3:16)&amp;nbsp; Ask God for the Spirit of wisdom and revelation so we can know him better (Eph 1:17; Jas 1:5)&amp;nbsp; Ask God to teach us to do his will (Ps 143:10; Heb 13:21)&amp;nbsp; Pray that the Lord increases our love and faith (1 Thess 3:10â12)&amp;nbsp; Pray in the Holy Spirit that we may be kept in Godâs love (Jude 20â21)"

The context of Romans 14 shows that Paul was talking about Mosaic regulations on days and food (see Rom 14:2 on refraining from meat). Galatians 4:10-11 is even clearer in that it refers to the observance of special occasions prescribed in Old Testament regulations. Neither passage dismisses the importance of the seventh day Sabbath â God was very specific about which day the Sabbath was. (Ex 16:23, 26; Ex 20:9-11; Deut 5:12-14). The Bible never says to choose one day out of seven as a Sabbath and observe it. God appointed the seventh day from the beginning (Gen 2:1-3)."

Even the demons believe that Jesus is the Son of God (Mt 8:28-29; Lk 4:41), but their belief is not true faith (Jas 2:19-20).

Aren't sacraments likewise only signs, with no effect?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1270-pub.html,"The apostle Paul stresses that Abraham was justified before circumcision, not after (Romans 4:10-12). Circumcision was only a sign of the righteousness he had already received by faith. Aren't sacraments likewise only signs, with no effect? In terms of necessity, this passage in Romans cannot be used to argue that sacraments are not necessary. Sacraments are necessary for us because they are commanded by the Lord himself, just as circumcision was necessary for Abraham because it was commanded by God. Had Abraham denied the necessity of circumcision with the rationale that it was only a sign, would he still be a man of faith? In terms of saving effects, we cannot confuse circumcision with the sacraments. Circumcision is a covenant of flesh for Abraham and his earthly descendants (Gen 17:13). It is done by the hands of men and is a work of the law as such. Because no divine action is involved, its only function was to signify Godâs promise and justification of Abraham. More importantly, it was a foreshadow of the saving work of Christ to effect justification for all men, whether Jews or Gentiles. âWhat purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was madeâ (Gal 3:19). So the law, including circumcision, could only signify the reality, which is Christ. In the sacraments, on the contrary, there is divine action, mediated by Christ himself. Baptism, for instance, is a circumcision done by Christ, not by menâs hands (Col 2:11-12). Sacraments are on a totally different level from circumcision because they are divine actions rather than just symbolic signs."
1,56,"What is the difference between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1271-pub.html,"What is the difference between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit? There is only one God, i.e., Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same one God and one Spirit. There is no such thing as three Gods in one. The trinity doctrine is simply a materialistic spin on the concept of the Godhead. God is Spirit, yet to suit our own tastes people have tried to âmaterializeâ God in the form of idols, saints, or trinitarian doctrines. God called Himself âusâ in the Bible (Gen 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Jn 17:22), which may seems like separate identities and persons; however, we can better understand Godâs three parts (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) as different functions at various stages of world history than as three different persons. For example, we would not say Joe, a father to Sam and the son of Mike, who goes to work as a carpenter is three different people. Joe is Joe, regardless of which functions/roles He is working in. The Holy Father revealed the power of creation (Gen 1:1); the Son revealed salvation (Rom 3:24); and, the Holy Spirit reveals Godâs will and guides Godâs people (Jn 16:13). Yet we cannot say God is three different persons in one body, for they are all one (Jn 10:30). God is one. The Jewish people never believed in more than one God, for that is the essence of monotheism. Christianity, in the tradition of Judaism, never believed in more than one God. Only years after Christ died did the controversy over Christâs divinity begin and did people come up with the doctrine of trinity or tri-unity. Like a man who is made up of spirit, soul, and body, God cannot be separated into three persons. God is the one and only. When Jesus was born, Isaiah the prophet called Jesus the âMighty Godâ and âEverlasting Fatherâ (Isa 9:6). In Hebrews 1:8, Jesus is referred to as a God. Acts 5:3 tells us He who deceives the Holy Spirit deceives God. Jesus said He came from heaven yet was still in heaven (Jn 3:13 KJV). All this shows that God is one and not three Gods in one. As stated earlier, we have limited knowledge of Godâs divine nature. Like seeing a poor reflection in a mirror, we are limited because we are flesh not spirit. One day, we hope to see God face to face and know God fully, just as Christ knows us fully (1 Cor 13:12)."
1,58,Do baptized believers who have not received the Holy Spirit belong to Christ?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1273-pub.html,"Do baptized believers who have not received the Holy Spirit belong to Christ? Those who have been baptized into Christ certainly belong to Christ (Gal 3:27-29). As far as Godâs salvation is concerned, baptism and receiving the Holy Spirit are two sides of the same coin. The promise of the Holy Spirit is given to everyone who accepts Godâs grace through baptism (Acts 2:38-39). Believers who have been baptized belong to Christ, and the promise of the Holy Spirit is already theirs. In time, they will receive the promise."

For one thing, the basic problems of human life remain the same: how to deal with evil and suffering; how to find something lasting in a life so finite and frail; and, ultimately, how to receive eternal life. The Bible gives us the answer to our problems, a solution thatâs good for all ages: Jesus Christ. To see for yourself what the Bible is good for, you canât just skim through or read it like any other book. You have to put its teachings into practice in your life."

The Lord Jesus said, âBut of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father onlyâ (Mt 24:36). No one can know the exact day of the Lordâs coming. But we can know the time is at hand by observing the signs and events the Bible foretells: Immorality is prevalent. People sin without guilt or conscience (2 Tim 3:1-5; Rev 9:20-21) Knowledge is increasing (Dan 12:4). Nations dissolve and war with one another (Mt 24:7; Rev 6:3-4). Famine, pestilence, and earthquakes increase (Rev 6:7-8; Lk 21:11; Isa 24:17-20). The Holy Spirit is poured out and the spiritual Israel, the Church, restored (Joel 2:28-32; Ezek 36:24-27; Isa 2:1-3; Ezek 31:21-11). False religions abound and false prophets arise (Rev 9:18-20; Mt 24:4-5, 11, 23-24; Rev 13:11-13). The Antichrist arises (Rev 13:1-7; Dan 11:36-37; 2 Thess 2:3-10). The Gospel of the Kingdom is preached all over the earth (Mt 24:14; Rev 10-11; Rev 11:3-7). The church will be greatly persecuted (Mt 24:10; Rev 6:9-11; Rev 20:7-10)."
1,62,How does God feel towards humankind?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1277-pub.html,"How does God feel towards humankind? Many people, who have a vague notion or belief in God, feel like God is very distant. Some people even curse God in their trials, feeling God has abandoned or even cursed them. Yet, the Bible gives us a very different picture of God then what we might believe. God is not some evil puppet-master who likes to make us suffer. The Bible tells us God loves humankind and draws people with an everlasting love (Jn 3:16; Jer 31:3). Everyone has been disobedient and forgetful of God at some point in their life. The world today, with all its violence, immorality, and pride, shows why humanity, left to its own ways, will eventually destroy itself. This may seem pessimistic, yet massive problems like war would be easy to resolve if the international community lived by biblical principles. God does not want to destroy people. In fact, Godâs faithfulness and love give all of us an opportunity to turn from our sins and receive Godâs saving grace. Jesus once shared a parable about the return of a wayward son, who forsook his fatherâs kindness to make it on his own. The father received the son back with open arms, even though the son wasted his inheritance. Jesus used the parable of the prodigal son to demonstrate how Godâs treatment toward those who left Godâs kindness to seek after their own agenda. God wants to receive us back with open arms (Lk 15:20; 1 Jn 3:1), but we often deny God. So God once said, âAll day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary peopleâ (Rom 10:21)."
1,63,What did Jesus preach?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1278-pub.html,"What did Jesus preach? Jesusâ first words in His ministry were: âThe time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospelâ (Mk 1:15). He also said, âThe Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, Because He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; 19 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD. â (Lk 4:18â19). These words show the grace with which the Lord came to the world. It also shows why we must believe in Him."
1,64,"Romans 10:9 says that ""if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.""

Repentance is also not mentioned here; is repentance, then, not necessary for salvation? It sure is! (See Mt 3:2; Acts 3:19; 2:38; 11:18; 2 Cor 7:10.) So we cannot deny the effect and necessity of sacraments based on this verse. We must bring this verse into harmony with other verses in the Bible to understand all the necessary steps to salvation. In this passage, Paul is emphasizing justification and salvation through faith as opposed to seeking to establish one's own righteousness without Christ (see Rom 10:3). The argument in verses 9 and 10 is drawn from verse 8, which quotes Deuteronomy 30:14: &amp;quot;But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it&amp;quot; (note the repeated use of the words &amp;quot;mouth&amp;quot; and heart&amp;quot;). The word is in our mouth and in our heart so we may obey it (Deut 30:11-18). Paul cited this passage to show that Christ is the Word become flesh, whom we should confess and believe. This confession and belief is realized in the obedience to Christâthe Word. His argument here was to show that observance apart from Christ cannot attain righteousness. He was not at all saying that confession and belief in Christ removed the need for sacraments. In fact, true confession of and belief in Christ would involve obedience to the Lord's command to receive the sacraments."

God said to the serpent, who represents Satan, âHe [Eveâs seed] shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heelâ (Gen 3:15). This was one of the earliest predictions of Jesus as the Savior of the world. On the surface, Jesus lost the battle and darkness reigned (Lk 22:53). However, Jesusâ death was a fatal blow to Satan, that âthrough death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and release all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondageâ (Heb 2:14-15). Jesusâ death signifies obedience to God, redemption for humanity, and victory over Satan/Devil."

Jesus gave us a new and living hope through his resurrection (1 Pet 1:3). Jesusâ resurrection opens the way to revive our spirit, which had been dead in sin, and restore it to life (Col 2:12â13). Jesusâ resurrection also gives life to our mortal bodies in the last days (Rom 8:11, 23; Jn 6:39â40). Jesus is the first fruit (first of its kind) of the resurrected, and God, who raised Jesus from the dead, will also raise us from the dead (2 Cor 4:14). So the Bible says that our seat is in the heavenly places (Eph 2:6). How wonderful a grace God gives to us through Jesusâ resurrection!"
1,67,"You say salvation is by grace, but aren't there any conditions to us receiving grace?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1282-pub.html,"You say salvation is by grace, but arenât there any conditions to us receiving grace? Like true love, true grace is often seen as being unconditional. But even unconditional love cannot be received unless it is received in true faith. So the Bible says, âFor by grace you have been saved through faithâ (Eph 2:8). True faith can be viewed as the condition by which we receive Godâs grace. Grace came through Jesus Christ (Jn 1:17). Grace comes freely, but it must be received in faith. The Bible says faith comes through hearing the gospel and believing in it (Rom 10:14, 17). Without faith you cannot receive Godâs saving grace in truth (Heb 11:6). The Bible says Godâs grace comes by faith so that it may be by grace (Rom 4:16). So we see that grace is, in some sense, conditioned upon our faith. However much faith we have, the grace of God follows. A true faith in God means we rest ourselves on Godâs sure foundation, i.e., we have total trust and confidence in God (Heb 3:14). Faith entails belief (Acts 13:39), obedience (Rom 16:26), and trust (Jn 12:36). A true faith will not lie dead and dormant. We can say we have all the faith in the world, but without any action to back it up, faith is meaningless. Like seeing a person say so convincingly, âI love youâ only to stab the same person in the back probably sickens us, saying âI have faith in Godâ and then living in sin should sicken us (Jas 2:18ff)."

1,69,Has the Holy Spirit remained with the church since Pentecost?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1284-pub.html,"Has the Holy Spirit remained with the church since Pentecost? The Holy Spirit comes from God. Heaven and earth are created by God. Likewise, God created the church. On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured down like rain, anointing believers who were waiting for Jesusâ promised Holy Spirit in Jerusalem. When the Holy Spirit falls on believers, we call that the baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5). The Bible relates the Holy Spirit with ârain,â including autumn and spring rainâtwo important rain periods for agricultural purposes (Deut 11:14; Jas 5:7, 18). Like farmers, God plants and harvests crops with rain (i.e., the Holy Spirit). Spring and autumn are important rainy seasons, while winter is the most rainy in Palestine, often characterized as torrential rain (Song 2:11). Jesusâ resurrection was symbolized by the feast of first fruits, a Jewish feast celebrating the initial fruits of the harvest. Pentecost was the Greek name for the Jewish feast of weeks, called Pentecost because it was seven weeks (49 days) after the first fruits. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost signaled the pouring of the autumn rain, necessary for the growth of the harvest. But there was a stop in the descent of the Holy Spirit, which is noted by a break in the historical timeline of spiritual tongues, which evidence receiving the Holy Spirit. Even Pentecostals, a group of Christians who uphold the Pentecostal experience of speaking in tongues, are often confused why speaking in tongues stopped for a certain period in church history. This stopping period can be paralleled to the winter season, which though characterized by torrential rain, was actually a period of drought for the church. The Holy Spirit again descended early in the twentieth century, in 1917, and established the True Jesus Church. The Holy Spiritâs outpouring at the present time is parallel to the spring rain in Palestine. Spring is followed by summer. Jesus prophesied: âNow learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near--at the doors!â (Mt 24:32â33). The fig tree represented the kingdom of Israel, restored in 1948, which began budding and leafing. We now know the coming of the Lord is near, i.e., that summer is near. We are living in the time of the spring rain, which will be followed by summer (fire). In the past, i.e., in the winter period, the sky was shut with drought (Lk 4:25; Jas 5:17). Drought comes about because of the sins of the church. Revelation 11:6 prophesied that after the apostles died, the early church would begin to deviate from the truth and the heavens would be shut. The church declined when it began to deviate from the truth and became politicized. The church eventually split, due to political maneuverings, into the eastern and western church (Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic). We see from church history that very early on the Holy Spirit stopped its descending. How do we know, we see the stoppage of the Holy Spirit of truth, evidenced by speaking in tongues."

None of these dates can be verified. We simply donât know the day Jesus was born."

Canât I just become a member of the church? If repentance alone can cleanse our sins, then why does Acts 22:16 say, âAnd now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sinsâ? Belief is the first and underlying requisite for salvation. It is by faith that one repents and is baptized. But repentance is coupled with baptism. Acts 2:38 says, ""Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."" It is during baptism, not repentance, that sin is washed away (see Rom 6:3ff). The church is the body of Christ, âwhich He purchased with His own bloodâ (Acts 20:28). Therefore we become a member of the body of Christ when we are baptized and redeemed by Jesusâ blood."

How can you be happy there if you do nothing but worship all day? Heaven is too ""spiritual"" and boring. How can you be happy there if you do nothing but worship all day? ""Boredom"" is simply another label for the spiritual emptiness in people due to our alienation from God. When we go to heaven, we will not be in our present earthly bodies. The spiritual bodies we will have will be marvelously different. We cannot project our fleshly limitations onto the glorious spiritual state in heaven. The joy of being with the Lord in heaven is ""far better"" than anything we can experience on earth (Phil 1:23). It's no wonder Peter, who had only a glimpse of the Christ in glory on the Mount of Transfiguration (Mt 17:1-4), wanted to stay there. We may think that without earthly pleasures, heaven will be dull. But what our flesh enjoys on earth will seem childish when we are in our spiritual bodies in heaven. As adults, we don't even think about the toys we ""couldn't live without"" when we were children. Likewise, when we are in heaven, we will ""put away childish things"" (1 Cor 13:9-12). Perfect eternal joy will replace our short-lived earthly joys. Believers who have ""tasted the heavenly gift"" and ""become partakers of the Holy Spirit"" (Heb 6:4) know from personal experience that the joy of spiritual communion with the Lord far surpasses any earthly pleasure. No wonder Paul would rather choose to be with Christ. Even thought we have not fully experienced the joy of heaven, our foretaste of God's immense love through the Holy Spirit (Rom 5:5; 2 Cor 1:21-22) tells us that heaven is anything but boring."

The Sabbath rest does not only point to accepting the gospel but also to the eternal rest. This promise still stands (Heb 4:1); so we need to ""be diligent to enter that rest"" (Heb 4:11). Sabbath observance today also foreshadows the eternal Sabbath rest. This passage cannot be the basis for abolishing the Sabbath because the promise of eternal rest still remains. It does not say that we need not keep the Sabbath after we have placed our faith in Christ. Observance of the Sabbath day, being one of the Ten Commandments, still must be kept today. The weekly Sabbath was part of God's creation, for He ""blessed the seventh day and sanctified it"" (see Gen 2:2-3; Ex 20:11). Since God's creation has lasted to this very day, the Sabbath day instituted by God continues to be a blessed and holy day as it has always been since the creation week. The rest we have received in Christ Jesus does not and should not displace the rest on the seventh day or the observance of the Sabbath according to God's commandment."
1,75,What is your view on the Trinity?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1290-pub.html,"What is your view on the Trinity? Before we discuss the doctrine of one God in Jesus Christ, letâs look at a summary of the doctrine of Trinity: 1. God is one. 2. The Godhead consists of three distinct eternal coequal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are the same in substance, but distinct in subsistence. 3. God is indivisible and unquantifiable. 4. All three persons of the triune God are involved in every work of God in the world. All acts of God proceed from the Father, through his Son or Word or Image, in the power of his immanent Holy Spirit. 1 For example, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit can individually be said to raise the dead because, as God, each one does raise the dead. 2 The act is one act, performed by one God, but involving all three ways in which God is God. 3 5. Jesus is the second person of the Trinity. He is God, but He is neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit. The trinitarian view of God came as a result of an attempt to understand God rationally. Although the language of trinity was found in Christian confessions before this time, the word ""trinity"" itself was first formally used at the synod held at Alexandria, in A.D. 317, and took its place in the language of Christian theology for the first time in a Biblical work of Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, in Syria from A.D. 168 to 183. Based on the Bible, we do believe and agree that God is one, that Jesus Christ is God, and that the Bible does make a distinction between the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. But we cannot fully agree with with the trinitarian view of God for the following reasons: 1. The use of words and concepts such as ""trinity,"" ""three persons,"" ""coequal,"" ""substance,"" and ""subsistence"" are often misleading. If these terms would clarify the concept of God, the Bible would have used them. The fact that they are absent shows that we must be careful about using our own terms when we explain God. Even theologians such as the Cappadocians, Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin all used the word ""person"" reluctantly and with much qualification. 4 Many well-respected trinitarians feel that it is misleading and should actually be dropped from contemporary trinitarian creeds. 5 2. We must admit that all theories about Godâs being fail to accurately explain God. It is not wise to define God with human concepts and put Him neatly into a model because in so doing, we easily step beyond and sometimes contradict Godâs self-revelation through the Scriptures. For example, the belief that Jesus Christ is not the Father or the Holy Spirit contradicts certain passages in the Bible. Such misconception has led to teachings that do away with baptism in the name of Jesus Christ or restrict believers to praying to the Father alone but not to the Lord Jesus. References: 1. Gregory A.

Therefore, Jesus tells us he is the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the Father except through him (Jn 14:6). This shows the way to the Father (God) is only gained through Jesus. Unfortunately, other religions who feel Jesus is simply one of a line of prophets sent by God have not looked at Jesusâ words carefully. There is no other way! Jesus was not only a teacher, Jesus also gave himself up as a ransom for many (1 Tim 2:6). Jesusâ sacrifice on the cross for us opened the way to God for us. We can never be saved apart from Jesus."
1,80,Why was there a Holy Spirit drought? What verses in the Bible tell us more?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1295-pub.html,"Why was there a Holy Spirit drought? What verses in the Bible tell us more? The Old Testament gives many reasons for spiritual drought: Deuteronomy 11:16â17 says, âTake heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them, lest the LORD's anger be aroused against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you.â Jeremiah 5:24â25 says, ""the LORD our God, Who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season. He reserves for us the appointed weeks of the harvest."" Your iniquities have turned these things away, And your sins have withheld good from you.â Jeremiah 3:2â3: âYou have polluted the land With your harlotries and your wickedness. Therefore the showers have been withheld, And there has been no latter rain. â Although these verses were spoken to the Israelites long ago, they also indicate reasons why the Holy Spirit stopped descending on the New Testament church as evidenced by church history. During the reign of king Ahab, the nation of Israel experienced drought for three and a half years, because Ahab led the people into idol worship and served Baal, a false god. Ahab did more to provoke Godâs anger than all the kings of Israel before him (1 Kgs 16:32â33). The drought experienced in Ahabâs time is paralleled in church history after the corruption of the early church. Soon after apostle John, who recorded the problems of the seven churches in Revelation, died, the church gradually deviated from the truth. Martyrs, who died in the great persecution of Christians in early church history, were often idolized as saints. Many Christians, therefore, went astray and fell into idolatry. The Holy Spirit of truth found no truth. The church was corrupted and the Holy Spirit natually left the church. But all of this was according to Godâs will. In due time, God would again send his Holy Spirit at the proper time."
1,81,"Since Jesus was sinless as the Son of God, why was he willing to sacrifice himself on the cross?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1296-pub.html,"Since Jesus was sinless as the Son of God, why was he willing to sacrifice himself on the cross? Because Jesus wanted to accomplish Godâs will and God willed to crush Jesus and make him suffer. God willed such a horrible death because Jesus was a guilt offering for others (Isa 53:10). Only by Jesusâ sacrifice could God realize his plan of redeeming sinners (Jn 18:11; 1 Jn 4:10). So Jesus willingly gave up his life to become a ransom for many (Mk 10:45). The Bible says that Jesus, âwho for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shameâ (Heb 12:2)."
1,82,Why do so many people worship on Sunday?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1297-pub.html,"Why do so many people worship on Sunday? There is no record in the New Testament stating that churches in the first century ever kept Sunday as a day of religious worship. The origin of Sunday worship, according to historians, was post-apostolic: The first Christian church established at Jerusalem by apostolic authority became its doctrine and practice a model for the greater part of those founded in the first centuryâ¦These Judaizing Christians were first known by the outside world as âNazarenesââ¦All Christians agreed in celebrating the seventh day of the week in conformity to the Jewish converts. (Schaff, Phillip, The History of the Christian Church, [Grand Rapids, Michigan: WM. B. Eerdmanâs, 1994], 7:50, 51, 69) The Sabbath had been a prominent feature in the Jewish creed and practice, and since much bitter prejudice grew up between the pagan converts and the Jewish elements in the church, the heathen element gradually gained control, and succeeded in effacing much of what they considered Judaistic. The fact that Justin Martyr and others began to press their antinomian theories shows that the Sabbath was yet an institution which had a strong hold on the church, even on the Gentile converts. The Sabbath was not discarded during the apostolic days. (John Kiesz, âA History of the Sabbath and Sundayâ in Christian Resource Centre (Bermuda) Version 2001.1 [January 26, 2001]) The apostle Paul had warned the early Christians concerning the falling away of the church: For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. (Acts 20:29-30) For fifty years after St. Paulâs life, a curtain hangs over the church, through which we vainly strive to look; and when at last the curtain rises, about A.D. 120, with the writings of the earliest church fathers, we find a church in many aspects very different from that in the days of St. Peter and St. Paul. (Jesse L. Hurlbut, The Story of the Christian Church [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1986], 41) God had revealed through the prophecy of Daniel that during the âfourth kingdom,â the Roman Empire, the saints of the Most High would be persecuted. The âfourth beast,â the Roman Emperor, âshall intend to change times and lawâ (Dan 7:23-25). His prophecy is amazingly accurate. Constantine was emperor of Rome from A.D. 306 to 337. He was a worshiper of the sun during the first years of his reign, but later professed conversion to Christianity. The Emperor Constantine changed the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath to Sunday by law in A.D. 321: On the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and people residing in the cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country, however, persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits; because it often happens that another day is not so suitable for grain growing or for vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations, the bounty of heaven should be lost.â â Given the 7th day of March, Crispus and Constantine being consuls each of them for the second time. ( Codex Justinianus 3.12-3, translated by Philip Schaff, in History of the Christian Church [Grand Rapids, Michigan: WM. B. Eerdmanâs, 1994] 3:380) Unquestionably the first law, either ecclesiastical or civil, by which the Sabbatical observance of that day is known to have been ordained, is the edict of Constantine, 321 A.D. ( Chambersâ Encyclopedia , n.d., s.v. âSabbathâ) The Roman Catholic Church neither denies nor attempts to conceal this substitution of Sunday for the Sabbath. The Catholic Church bases Sunday observance on the authority of the Pope and not on the Holy Bible. It regards the change as evidence of the Catholic Churchâs power to change a commandment of God: You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify. (James Cardinal Gibbons, The Faith of our Fathers , 1893 ed. [Baltimore, Maryland: Tan Books, 1917], 72-73) The Convertâs Catechism of Catholic Doctrine , received the âApostolic Blessâ of Pope Pius X on January 25, 1910: Question: Which is the Sabbath day? Answer: Saturday is the Sabbath day. Question: Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday? Answer: We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church, in the Council of Laodecia (AD 336), transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday. (2nd ed. St. Louis, Missouri: B. Herder Book Company: 1923], 50) As a result of the Catholic Churchâs change, however, Protestant, Evangelical, and other Christians, are greatly confused on the Sabbath issue."

Because God is Spirit and without limit, His time is different from our sense of time: But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. (2 Pet 3:8-9) What we see as a âdelayâ is merely the extension of Godâs mercy. Every day brings us closer to the end and the Judgment Day. Instead of doubting, make the most of the opportunity to grow closer and more like Christ. Be prepared at all times to meet Him, knowing that any day may be the last."

They are found in some versions of the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, but not in the Hebrew Old Testament.

They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.â The people in Samaria received the Holy Spirit after the apostles prayed for them. There was visible evidence because Simon âsawâ it happen (Acts 8:18). Acts 10:44-48: Peter knew Corneliusâ household had received the Holy Spirit because they spoke in tongues just as the apostles had on the day of Pentecost. Likewise, based on the experience of the apostles, we also know that a person today has received the Holy Spirit when he speaks in tongues. Acts 19:1-7: Paul asked the Ephesians, âDid you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?â and the response was negative. Why did Paul have to ask such a question if there is no physical sign when a person receives the Holy Spirit, or if a person receives the Holy Spirit the moment he believes? After they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, why didnât Paul just tell them, âyou have now received the Holy Spiritâ? When the Holy Spirit came upon the believers, there was clear evidence of speaking in tongues (Acts 19:6). Just like on the Day of Pentecost, the evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit today is still the gift of speaking in tongues."

According to Col 2:14, it was the ""handwriting of requirements that was against us"" that God has wiped out and nailed to the cross. The written code was nailed to the cross because it was ""contrary to us."" In other words, Christ's death has freed us from the condemnation of the law. This passage is not about the doing away of food, drink, festival, new moon, or sabbaths, but the abolition of the written code and regulations concerning these things. For example, God did not wipe out food or drink (in that case, we should not eat or drink), but he removed the regulations about food and drink. Likewise, this passage says nothing about abolishing the Sabbath commandment. The Sabbath, being one of the Ten Commandments, has not been abolished, but the strict regulations concerning the keeping of the Sabbath day were fulfilled by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. Christians today still need to keep the Ten Commandments."

Wonât God accept me if I try to be a good, sincere person? Trying to do good is an admirable quality. But without God, no matter how hard we try, we can never be perfectly good. We all have sin in our nature and have sinned in our lives (see Rom 3:23). Trying to do good is just not good enough, because we can never save ourselves from sin (Rom 3:20). Just because you are sincere, doesnât mean you are right. Sincerity in religious matters is not good enough, just as it is insufficient in other situations: âIs it sufficient that your surgeon, your accountant or your travel agent be sincere? Is sincerity alone enough to save you from cancer, bankruptcy, accident or death? It is not. Why then do you think it should be enough to save you from hell?â(Peter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli, Handbook of Christian Apologetics [Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsiy Press, 1994], 323). The only way we can fulfill Godâs righteous standards is to rely on God. He has provided us salvation from sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The only way we can be saved is through faith in Jesus Christ, for He alone can deliver us from sin and judgment (Eph 2:8-9; Titus 3:5)."

Through the creation of the universe, God revealed Himself plainly to us (Rom 1:20). ""For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God"" (Heb 3:4; Gen 1:1). So in contrast to the dead idols many people worship, the God of the Bible is a true and living God (Jer 10:10; 1 Thess 1:9)."
1,92,"With all the other ways we can remember the Lord's death today, is the Holy Communion really that important, and even necessary for salvation?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1307-pub.html,"With all the other ways we can remember the Lord's death today, is the Holy Communion really that important, and even necessary for salvation? After the Lord Jesus gave thanks, broke the bread and gave it to the disciples, he said, âThis is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Meâ (Lk 22:19; see also 1Cor 11:23-25). The Lord clearly instructed that partaking the Holy Communion is the way to remember his death. It is by keeping the Holy Communion that we proclaim the Lordâs death (1Cor 11:26). How then can we dismiss the Holy Communion as unimportant? Partaking of the bread and the cup to proclaim the Lordâs death was to be done not only by the apostles but also by all believers, even those of modern age, until the Lord comes (1Cor 11:26). The partaking of the bread and the cup during Holy Communion is not merely a custom or formality. While it is an occasion to remember and proclaim the Lordâs death, it carries great significance and spiritual efficacy, and consists of essential spiritual functions for believers. By partaking of the Holy Communion: We unite with the Lord in the Holy Spirit (1Cor 10:16; the Greek word for âcommunionâ in 1Cor 16:16 is KoinÃ´nia, meaning fellowship; Jn 6:56); and we also unite with one another (1Cor 10:17).

He wants everyone to turn from evil and live eternally (Ezek 18:31-32; 33:11). Out of His love, He even gave His own son to us so that we might have eternal life (Jn 3:16-17). While God offers everyone love and forgiveness, He doesnât force His love on those who do not want it. Because He loves us, He wants us to be free. We are given free choice to accept or deny Godâs love. God does allow everyone to go to heaven, but not everyone chooses heaven. If a person chooses to sin and refuses to repent, he chooses to reject Godâ love. By rejecting Godâs love, he chooses hell; hell in essence is the absence of Godâs love. There is no other choice, because the only place where Godâs love does not exist is hell."
1,94,Can we receive the grace of forgiveness and eternal life by saying that Jesus is my Lord?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1309-pub.html,"Can we receive the grace of forgiveness and eternal life by saying, ?Jesus is my Lord?? While believing in Jesus is vitally important to our salvation, a superficial belief does not result in salvation by grace (cf. Mt 7:21). As we have said before, grace is received with a true and honest faith. For example, food sustains our life. But if you keep saying food is good and nutritious but never eat food, you will still eventually starve to death. The grace food imparts is useless (dead) if your faith in food has no substance! The right definition of faith is so important, especially since many reformed Christians will ardently tell other Christians faith equals mere belief with no action. To make this point clear, let's look at another analogy. A sick patient will often need to see a doctor. But if the patient simply trusts in the skills of a doctor yet never listens to the doctor's advice or visits the doctor's office, the patient will never receive the benefits of the doctor's expertise. In the same way, Jesus once told a blind man to wash in the water. Let me ask those who feel salvation by faith can be had with a superficial belief: if the blind man never listened to Jesus and never went to wash in the water, do you honestly believe he would have been healed? (The story in the Bible indicates he did listen, and was healed.) Again, let me ask: if the woman in biblical records who suffered from haemorrhaging for twelve years only believed in her heart, but never reached out to touch Jesus' clothes for healing, do you think the Lord's power would have healed her as it did? James says, ""Do you see that faith was working together with his [Abraham's] works, and by works faith was made perfect?"" (Jas 2:22). A true faith gives us access to God's grace. The Bible says, ""Through whom [Jesus] also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand"" (Rom 5:2). But our faith must have substance in order to save us, which was why James asked those who had a superficial faith: ""Can [his dead] faith save him?"" (Jas 2:14). The answer is obviously ""No."" However, we must also remember that God's grace is what saves us. So if we are saved by grace, why even bother about faith? Because we can only gain access to grace through our faith. Faith is like a bridge we need to receive God's grace, for faith in God is God's way. We can imagine a treasure (grace) that is on the other side of a deep rift we cannot reach without a bridge; we need the bridge (faith) to get to the treasure (grace), but the bridge (faith) is not the treasure (grace) itself. It is God's saving grace that has saved people throughout the ages, both Jews and Gentiles (Acts 15:11). So we are not saved by works, but by grace. But our faith, which entails substance, gives us access to God's saving grace. Faith must have a substance beyond a mere superficial confession saying, ""Jesus is Lord!"" (cf. Mt 7:21ff) - a point we can't emphasize enough. While it is obvious we are justified by grace, we may ask what exactly grace entails? Titus 3:5 (cf. Jn 3:5) comments on the grace we have received as believers, ""He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life."" The grace that justified us, as recorded in Titus 3:5, means the washing of rebirth (water baptism) and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit (baptism of the Holy Spirit). If we can understand that God's grace has manifestations of substance and form, then we can better understand why we need to be baptized and receive the Holy Spirit for salvation. Unfortunately, many Christians feel a belief, for example, that Christians must receive water baptism, footwashing, or the Holy Spirit in order to be saved by grace, is a heresy of salvation by ""works"". But the foundation of the argument against saving efficacy of water baptism, the Holy Spirit, etc. is more firmly rooted in the reformed theology of Martin Luther than in the Bible. The Bible says, in no uncertain terms, that God's grace is the very fact we can receive water baptism, the Holy Spirit, etc. to salvation. Jesus provided water baptism for the forgiveness of sins; Jesus gives us the gift of baptism in the Holy Spirit as part and parcel of his plan of salvation. Both baptism of water and the Holy Spirit are manifestations of God's grace, much as Jesus became flesh to dwell among us in the fullness of grace and truth. Jesus opened up the way to God's throne of salvation, through Jesus' shed blood on the cross, to allow water baptism to forgive our sins. The way to salvation is something we freely receive with faith, for it is a grace of God. So Jesus once said, ""He who believes and is baptized will be saved"" (Mk 16:16; cf. Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet 3:21). The Bible also says, ""Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him [Jesus] were to receive"" (Jn 7:39). So to receive water baptism and the Holy Spirit, you must believe in Jesus. In the days after Jesus ascended into heaven, on Pentecost, Peter preached and said, ""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts 2:38). This verse, spoken by apostle Peter in answer to the question, ""What shall we do?"" is an excellent outline of the way of faith that leads to salvation by grace."

Obviously, Jesus never compromised with any of the parties listed above. Some people who saw Jesusâ miracles wanted to take Jesus by force and make Him king, perhaps leading the revolution to restore Israel; however, Jesus withdrew himself before they could make Him king (Jn 6:15). Jesus told us clearly when on trial, âMy kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.â (Jn 18:36).

His going forth is established as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter and former rain to the earthâ (Hos 6:3). We should pursue and live by Godâs truth, for the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth. God will only live with those who obey the truth (Acts 5:32). Seek the truth and God will give you the Holy Spirit. âAsk the LORD for rain In the time of the latter rain. The LORD will make flashing clouds; He will give them showers of rain, Grass in the field for everyoneâ (Zech 10:1). From this verse we learn we must ask for the Holy Spirit to be given. Elijah is a good example of asking for rain. âHe [Elijah] prayed again and the heaven gave rainâ¦â (Jas 5:18). Although it was in springtime, he had to ask for rain to make it come. The Bible tells us, âYou do not have, because you do not askâ (Jas 4:2). âAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Meâ¦ He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churchesâ (Rev 3:19â22). Sincere repentance are pre-conditions for receiving the Holy Spirit. Without sincerity and purity of heart and honest repentance we canât find a way to God. The reason is simple: God hates the proud and deceitful, known characteristics of Satan. Insincerity and pride are the double-edged sword that will kill your chances of getting the Holy Spirit.

1,99,Why are some prayers not answered immediately?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1314-pub.html,"Why are some prayers not answered immediately? There are many reasons why our prayers may not have been answered immediately. Hereâs a short list for us to consider: We may have sin in our hearts (Ps 66:18). Sin, like a covering of cloud, fogs our way and hinders our prayer from getting through (Lam 3:44). How can we get rid of the fog of sin? The Bible tells us that we must have a heart pleasing before God, for our prayers should be like sweet smelling incense before God (Ps 141:2). After we have the right attitude and motivation, we should examine ourselves and repent of our sins (2 Cor 7:10â11). Godâs time may not have come yet (Eccl 3:1). God has an appropriate time for everything. We must always wait for the fullness of Godâs time. Sometimes it seems we have waited so long without an answer, but God always watches over his people (Rev 6:10â11). The Lord once ended a parable by saying, âAnd shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?â (Lk 18:7). Godâs purpose may be to test us so weâll learn how to pray and live by faith (Rom 12:12; Lk 18:1). If we can always wait for Godâs timing, we can better see the beauty of Godâs purpose."
1,101,Isn't footwashing just a Middle Eastern custom?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1316-pub.html,"Isnât footwashing just a Middle Eastern custom? The footwashing that the Lord Jesus instituted is more than a mere custom. According to tradtion, slaves washed the feet of the master, never the reverse. The Lord, however, washed the feet of His disciples even though He was their master. Peter, not realizing the significance of this footwashing, objected to being washed by the Lord (Jn 13:6,8). Footwashing is directly related to salvation for the following reasons: Jesus told Peter, âIf I do not wash you, you have no part with Meâ (Jn 13:8). To receive footwashing is to have a part with the Lord. As such, footwashing cannot be simply a custom. Jesus also said, âHe who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely cleanâ (Jn 13:10). A person who is baptized also needs to receive footwashing. Though formerly a custom, footwashing became a sacrament that carried great spiritual power and effect after the Lord Jesus had performed it and explained its meaning and efficacy, and had commanded His disciples to do likewise."
1,102,Isn't sprinkling a valid form of baptism?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1317-pub.html,"Isnât sprinkling a valid form of baptism? Sprinkling is not baptism. The word âbaptismâ is derived from the Greek word baptismos , which means âimmersion.â The Greek word baptein (baptism) means âto plunge, to immerse, or to washâ (see âBAPTISM,â The Encyclopedia of Religion , 1987 ed., Mircea Eliade, et al. [New York: Macmillan, 1987]). So when the candidate is immersed in water during baptism, his spiritual being is being cleansed. Hebrews 10:22 cannot be cited as a basis for sprinkling. In fact, this verse actually supports baptism by immersion because it describes how the heart, not the body, is being sprinkled spiritually, while the body is âwashed with pure waterâ physically (washed=immersed). According to Hastings, âThe external form of baptism was immersion in flowing water which is presupposed in Ac 822, He 1022â (Hastings, âBAPTISM,â Dictionary of the Bible [New York: Charles Scribnerâs Sons, 1963]). Similarly, in Ezekiel 36:25-26, cleansing through sprinkling figuratively denotes inward cleansing. (The reference is to Numbers 8:6-7.) In the Old Testament, the sprinkling of blood foreshadowed the spiritual cleansing of Jesusâ blood (see Heb 9:18-22). Thus âsprink1ing of the bloodâ in Peter 1:2 does not refer to the physical action of baptism, but to the effect of spiritual cleansing through Christâs blood."
1,103,What was the Roman empire like?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1318-pub.html,"What was the Roman empire like? Rome came to power many years before Christ at around 510 B.C. Rome conquered Greece, Egypt, Syria and other ancient civilizations. The Romans would later extend their territory to Europe, Asia, and Africa. Eastward, it reached the Euphrates; on the south it bordered on Africa and the Arabic desert. Its western side reached the Atlantic Ocean, while its north bordered on Germany. It was about 9,000 miles north to south and 6,000 miles west to east. Its population was at one time about 120 million. The Roman Empire was truly an impressive empire. Around 66 B.C., the Romans had already occupied about 21 neighboring nations. The result of Romeâs rise to power was an empire where the culture and knowledge of diverse nations would often converge. For example, Hellenistic or Greek culture and language spread throughout Syria and Macedonia. Many other Mediterranean countries adopted Greek as their commercial language. Thus, the New Testament portion of the Bible was originally written in Greek. From this we understand the importance of Greek culture and philosophy around Jesusâ time. But Greek thought was probably not reverenced by the very first Christian converts. Paul once said, âFor Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucifiedâ (1 Cor 1:22â23). âChrist [is] the power of God and the wisdom of Godâ (1 Cor 1:24)."

Godâs character was revealed to the world through Jesus Christ. The Bible tells us about Godâs character so that we can take part in the divine character (2 Pet 1:4). The following are examples of Godâs character. God is:&amp;nbsp; Holy (1 Pet 1:15; Lev 19:2) Light (1 Jn 1:5; Isa 2:5) Love (1 Jn 4:8; Jer 31:3) Compassionate (Ps 145:9; 2 Cor 1:3) Faithful (1 Cor 1:9; Ps 36:5) Just (1 Jn 2:29; Job 35:2) Peace (2 Cor 13:11; Isa 9:6) Patient (Neh 9:30; 2 Pet 3:9) Merciful (Rom 9:15; Joel 2:13) A jealous God (Deut 4:24; Heb 12:29) Hateful of sins (Prov 6:16â19; Heb 1:9) Majestic (Ps 93:1; Isa 26:10)
1,105,Why does God want to save the world anyway?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1320-pub.html,"Why does God want to save the world anyway? There are two major reasons God wants to save the world: God loves the world and desires to have mercy on his creation (Jn 3:16; 1 Jn 4:10, 16; Tit 3:5; Lk 1:78). God wants to manifest his glory to those he has mercy on (Rom 9:23). Motivated by his mercy and love, God gives abundant grace to his creation. The Bible says, âour God and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting consolation and good hope by graceâ (2 Thess 2:16). The Bible says, âI [God] will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassionâ (Rom 9:15). Godâs merciful salvation comes to us because of the great love with which he loves us (Eph 2:4)."

Jesus promises that âhe who believes and is baptized will be savedâ (Mk 16:16). âAnd now what are you waiting for?â Ananias, a follower of Christ, asked Saul. âGet up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on His nameâ (Acts 22:16). The Bible tells us why we need baptism: To be cleansed (Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16) To be saved (Mk 16:16; 1 Pet 3:21) To enter Godâs kingdom (Jn 3:5) To receive a new life (Rom 6:4) To put on Christ (Gal 3:27)"
1,107,"Can infants or children receive baptism if they do not understand the truth, do not have faith, and cannot repent?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1322-pub.html,"Can infants or children receive baptism if they do not understand the truth, do not have faith, and cannot repent? Infants and children are born with sin (Ps 51:5). Therefore they also need to be born again. The promise of baptism for the remission of sins is also given to the children (Acts 2:38-39). Children were never excluded from God's covenant with His people (Gen 17:9-14). We must not forbid children from receiving salvation since the Lord Jesus Himself loves little children, and does not reject them (see Lk 18:15-17). In the early church, entire households were baptized (Acts 16:15, 32-34; 18:8; 1Cor 1:16). Children and infants are, of course, part of the household. Children were healed of their diseases through their parents' faith (Mt 15:28). By the same token, children and infants may be baptized based on the faith of their parents (Jn 4:49-51). However, we must also keep in mind that it is the grace of God and the cross of Christ, not the conscious choice of humans, that gives baptism its effect. So even if children cannot make a conscious choice to receive God's grace, they should not be excluded from God's grace. Old Testament types for baptism also teach infant baptism. Circumcision prefigures baptism (Col 2:11-12). In the Old Testament the male infants of the chosen people are circumcised on the eighth day (Lev 12:2-3), prefiguring infant baptism. Crossing of the Red Sea also prefigures the New Testament baptism (1Cor 10:1-2). The Israelites, including the children and infants, crossed the Red Sea (Ex 10:9-10, 24; 12:31). The children and infants were not left in the land of bondage. In the same way, children and infants must also be baptized to be cleansed of their sins and be released from the bondage of Satan."

God brings creation into being and He brings His church into existence. The Bible tells us God is, was, and is to come (Rev 1:8; 4:8). God never changes, but remains the same forever (Heb 1:12; 13:8). God alone has immortality, that is, He has everlasting life in His hands (1 Tim 6:16). So God is called the âEverlasting Fatherâ (Isa 9:6) and the âeternal Godâ (Deut 33:27), for God is from everlasting to everlasting (Ps 90:2)."

We enter the gate by the Holy Spirit (Gal 3:3). The Bible says no one can honestly say âJesus is Lordâ except by the movement of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 12:3).&amp;nbsp; Jesus gives us the right to become children of God when we believe, calling God our Father (Jn 1:12; 20:17).&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the Holy Spirit allows us to be Godâs children, calling out âAbba! Father!â (Gal 4:6; Rom 8:14, 16).&amp;nbsp; Jesus revealed Godâs love (Jn 3:16; Rom 5:8).

The prophet, inspired by the Holy Spirit, said, âA virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel,â which means âGod is with usâ (Isa 7:14).

The word âTrueâ refers to the true God, for God is true (Jer 10:10; Rom 3:4; Isa 65:16; Jn 17:3; 7:28; 1Jn 5:20), and it shows that the church belongs to the true God. Jesus has made known the true God (Jn 1:18 KJV), and is the true God himself (1Jn 5:20). Jesus said, âI am the true vineâ (Jn 15:1), and âI am the way, the truth, and the lifeâ (Jn 14:6). The Bible also refers to the Lord Jesus as âthe true lightâ (Jn 1:9), and as âholy and trueâ (Rev 6:10). So it is proper that Jesus be called âTrue Jesus.â Because believers are branches of the true vine and they constitute the churchâthe body of Christâthe church is also the âTrue Churchâ. If the church belongs to the âTrue Godâ and the âTrue Jesus,â it is the âTrue Church.â The True Jesus Church does not only bear the name of the true church. The Holy Spirit abides with the church to testify that this church preaches the truth and that it is indeed the true Church (Heb 2:3-4; Eph 1:13-14; 2:22). We have no intention of condemning anyone; but that does not make the church any less true.

In Greco-Roman times, it was customary to wash oneâs feet after bathing, for even after a person had bathed (e.g. at a public bath), the feet would get dirty from the dust stirred up during the walk home. Footwashing was necessary to be completely clean. So even though baptism washes away our sins, footwashing prepares our feet to walk in righteousness and purity to reach our heavenly home."

True believers of Jesus Christ are members of the same body, the church (1 Cor 12:12-13, 27-28). The Lord Jesus imparts His salvation through His church. He sends out workers and gives His church the authority and power to forgive sins (Jn 2:21-23; Mt 16:18-19).

Jesus also explained the Bible and heavenly matters to His disciples, so they could better understand spiritual things (Lk 24:27, 45). Forty days after His resurrection, Jesus was taken up into heaven (Acts 1:3, 9). The Bible says He is seated at the right hand of God, an illustration of having a seat of importance (Heb 9:24; Rom 8:34). Jesus lives forever. He is able to completely save us who seek God because He constantly intercedes for us (Heb 7:24â25). Jesus is the great high priest who has passed through the heavens (Heb 4:14). So in some sense we can say Jesus went to heaven. But this is an understanding from the physical perspective. Actually, Jesus is God, who fills all the earth. So where is Jesus? As the Son of God, He is fulfilling His role as the Son. Yet, Jesus is spiritually God himself. So Jesus is everywhere, yet He is also in heaven interceding for us before the Father. He is also at the right hand of God, in a position of power. Donât place physical constraints on Jesus and donât think of heaven as a place with physical boundaries.

Pharisees. The Pharisees are the forerunners of todayâs modern rabbinic Judaism. Mostly composed of intellectuals, Pharisees included teachers of the law, scribes, and other high standing members (Lk 11:52). They were the most prestigous group in Jesusâ time. They accepted the Old Testament doctrines, rigidly adhering to the Mosaic law by emphasizing the laws of outward religiosity and purity. Many Pharisees (we cannot say all) felt they were above the people, being self-righteous and full of pride. Emphasizing outward form, many Pharisees were hypocriticalâlaying heavy burdens on the peopleâburdens they themselves would not bear. The Pharisees would eventually plan Jesusâ demise. We donât want to give the false impression that every Pharisee was evil or hypocritical, yet their portrayal in the New Testament was a sign of the times. The position and social environment of the times naturally led those in positions of power to a âholierâ and âbetter than thouâ attitude. The temple system was pretty corrupt by Jesusâ time. Jesus once saw a poor widow put in her whole livelihood for the temple treasury (cf. Mt 23:14), yet the Pharisees came up with rules for their own benefit (Mk 7:11â13). Where was the justice there? Christians are often accused by modern Jews of giving the Pharisees a bad reputation, yet the times indicate there was a rampant abuse of power. Sadducees. The Sadducees were made up of the high priest and his associates (Acts 5:17). Their doctrines were often opposed to the Pharisees. The Sadducees only upheld the authority of the Torah (or Pentateuch) and the writings. They did not believe in the eternal soul or the resurrection of the dead. They did not believe in angels, demons, or future judgment (Mk 12:18; Acts 23:8). The Sadducees, like the Pharisees, opposed Jesus and his ministry. They, like the Pharisees, plotted to take Jesusâ life. Herodians (royal faction). Herodians were a political party. When Judah became a vassal state of Rome, Herod the Great became king. Herod was an Idumean, considered a half-Jew by the Pharisees. Herod would convert to the Jewish religion and be circumcised, which is why he was called a Jew. The Jews, seeking political freedom and independence, hoped their support for Herod would help them expand their power. Thus, the Herodian party was formed (Mt 22:16). In Jesusâ time, Herod Antipas, Herod the Greatâs son, was the Galilean king (Lk 23:6â7). Zealots. Bible scholars who have read Josephus, a historian of the first century, used to believe there was a longstanding organized group that led the Jewish revolt of 66â74 C.E. against Rome. Many scholars now believe the reconstruction of such an organized group is unnecessary based on Josephusâ accounts. Scholars now say zealots were not around sixty years before the revolt of 66â74 C.E.; rather, they now believe zealots initially formed when the Jewish revolt began. The zealots, then, were a network of groups with a common goal of overthrowing Rome. Many of the members were bandits. The Sicarii or âdagger people,â numbered among the zealots, would often just gut people on city streets with their blades. Simon, one of Jesusâ twelve disciples, was called a zealot (Mt 10:4). However, we do not know in what sense the Bible called Simon a zealot. If, as scholars now believe, the zealots were not an organized force at Jesusâ time, then Simon was zealous in some way we do not know about. The Bible does not mention much about the zealot party, so the new consensus that zealots were not around at Jesusâ time carries some weight. However, at this point, we simply do not know much about the history of the zealots."

God did not create a world of robots to mechanically serve His purposes. He shows us what is good: &amp;quot;to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly&amp;quot; with him (Mic 6:8). He also gives us commandments so that we may understand the consequences of our choices (Rom 5:13). But He permits us the freedom to do as we will, and by allowing that freedom, He allows the possibility of sin. Love requires an object. God created the universe to manifest His Love. But true love can only exist with freedom, just as true righteousness can only exist with freedom. We cannot truly love if we are forced to do so against our will; we cannot be morally perfect if we do not choose to do good out of our own volition. Adam and Eve sinned because they failed to obey the command God had given them, despite their knowledge of the consequences. Their disobedience displayed a lack of faith in God and introduced the separation between God and man. But God also prepared the way of reconciliation. He came into the world as Jesus Christ and suffered lifeâs hardships with us. Jesus demonstrated that it is possible to have free will and not sin. He satisfied Godâs requirement for justice and manifested Godâs love on the cross by paying the ultimate price for human evil: death and complete severance from God."

The Bible says, â[I]n quietness and confidence shall be your strengthâ (Isa 30:15). In our day to day lives, we are often so busy that we forget we need to set aside time for ourselves to pray. Our hearts become so busy we only think about our daily problems, not the solution that lies in God. Only in quietness can we seek the Lordâs face (Ps 27:4). Jesus himself often withdrew to lonely places to pray (Lk 5:16). Although quiet surroundings are ideal, quietness is more a matter of the heart than an environmental prerequisite for good prayer. Our heart should block out any external and internal disturbances that may cause us to lose focus in our prayer. We have to come to an internal quiet and peace within ourselves to have an effective prayer. Having deep personal communion with God in prayer should be a treasured time. We should try to pray at least three times a day (Dan 6:10; Ps 55:17). Additionally, even seemingly insignificant silent prayers, which may only last a few minutes, can help us gain a little more peace of mind in our walk with God. Besides silent prayer, we may pray with a few simple words of understanding. We can pray on all occasions in the Spirit (Eph 6:18). We can pray at all times, e.g., when riding a bus, taking a ship cruise, walking in the park, etc. Our bodies are Godâs living temples, and the Holy Spirit intercedes for us on all occasions. Prayer is a Christianâs lifeline to resist Satanâs temptations. We cannot really live a healthy Christian life without any prayer life. Jesusâ three prayers in Gethsemane can be viewed as three lines of defense against the weakness of the flesh. Prayer helps us overcome the weaknesses of the flesh. So if we are watchful in our prayer life, we will ultimately have a complete victory in Christ!"
1,123,Which day of the week did the apostles keep?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1338-pub.html,"Which day of the week did the apostles keep? The Bible states that the apostle Paul kept the Sabbath day, as his custom was (Acts 17:1-3). In Corinth, where Paul labored a year and six months, he âreasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeksâ (Acts 18:4). At Antioch and Philippi, Paul observed the Sabbath and taught in the synagogues on that day (Acts 13:14; 16:12,13). At Antioch, âthe Gentiles begged âthat these words might be preached to them the next Sabbathâ¦On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of Godâ (Acts 13:42-44). When Paul and Silas came to Philippi, a Gentile city in Greece, there was no synagogue but it did not stop them from worshiping on the Sabbath: âAnd on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily madeâ (Acts 18:4)."
1,124,"If Jesus is God, why did He pray to His Father?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1339-pub.html,"If Jesus is God, why did He pray to His Father? Jesus Christ did not assume the position of the Father. As God who did not consider equality with God something to be grasped (Phil 2:6-8) and who shared our humanity (Heb 2:14), Jesus identified himself as the Son and called God His Father. But we should not go beyond the Bible and say that He is not the Father. We canât try to think of God in human terms, because God is spirit. We have to acknowledge that the relationship between the Father and the Son is beyond human reason. How could He be in three places at one time during baptism? God is omnipresent: He is present everywhere. He is beside you right now, at the same time as He is present on the other side of the world. Even though as humans we cannot conceive how God can be at many different places at the same time, we canât limit God to our human concepts. He is Spirit, and He transcends all physical limitations."
1,125,Isn't the Bible full of inaccuracies?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1340-pub.html,"Isnât the Bible full of inaccuracies? No scientific or archaeological discovery has ever disproved any of the Bibleâs accounts. In fact, certain biblical passages that were thought to be mistakes have later been confirmed to be true. Error lies not in the Bible, but in our misinterpretation resulting from our limited knowledge. As we continue to learn about the world around us, we gain a better understanding of biblical claims and Godâs greatness. Besides, to read the Bible solely as a scientific manual or a historical account would be missing its point. We ought to read the Bible to learn about God and His salvation."

1,127,What is the biblical support for baptizing people with their heads bowed?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1342-pub.html,"What is the biblical support for baptizing people with their heads bowed? In Romans 6:3-4, Paul states that believers are ""buried with Christ through baptism into death."" Through baptism, we receive the spiritual effect of dying with Christ. Paul continues in verse 5, ""For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection"" (Rom 6:5). Since our death with Christ is signified by baptism, our union with Christ in the likeness of his death is also signified by baptism. In other words, the manner of baptism during biblical times was in the likeness of the Lord's death. Paul uses this physical likeness in baptism to discuss the spiritual likeness that believers carry. The description of the physical likeness of Jesus' death is found in John 19:30, ""bowing His head, He gave up His spirit."" This is the only detail that John records. He describes the appearance of the Lord's death even though the appearance should have been normal for a person who died on the cross. It is on this basis that we understand what the physical likeness of the Lord's death refers to. In the Bible, the bowing of one's head is a gesture that signifies disgrace and heaviness of sin (Ps 40:12; Lk 18:13; Job 10:15). Just as Christ died to sin once for all, we also die to sin so that sin should no longer have power over us (Rom 6:2, 10). As we bow our heads and be immersed in water, our sinful self dies and is buried with Christ. As we rise from the water, we are raised with Christ and receive a new life in him (Rom 6:4; Col 2:12)."
1,128,Isn't footwashing merely a Jewish custom? How is it related to a person's salvation?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1343-pub.html,"Isn't footwashing merely a Jewish custom? How is it related to a person's salvation? The footwashing that the Lord Jesus instituted is more than a mere custom. According to tradition, slaves washed the feet of the master, never the reverse. The Lord, however, washed the feet of His disciples even though He was their master. Peter, not realizing the significance of this footwashing, refused to be washed by the Lord (Jn 13:6,8). Footwashing is directly related to salvation for the following reasons: Jesus told Peter, &amp;quot;If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me&amp;quot; (Jn 13:8). To receive footwashing is to have part with the Lord. As such, footwashing cannot be simply a custom. Jesus also said, &amp;quot;He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean&amp;quot; (Jn 13:10). A person who is baptized needs also to receive footwashing. Though formerly a custom, footwashing became a sacrament that carries great spiritual power and effect after the Lord Jesus performed it and explained its meaning and efficacy and commanded His disciples to do likewise."
1,129,When does a believer receive the Holy Spirit?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1344-pub.html,"When does a believer receive the Holy Spirit? According to the Scriptures, a believer does not âautomaticallyâ receive the Holy Spirit the moment he or she believes the Lord Jesus Christ is their Savior. The people in Samaria had not received the Holy Spirit even though they had accepted the gospel and had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:12-17). In Acts 19:1-6, the very first thing Paul asked the disciples when he met them on the road was whether or not they had received the Holy Spirit when they believed. It was not until Paul laid hands on them that the Holy Spirit came upon them. A person must believe in âthe word of truth, the gospel of salvationâ in order to receive the Holy Spirit (Eph 1:13). A person cannot receive the Holy Spirit if he believes in a false gospel. Only those who believe, repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ will receive the Holy Spirit. Sometimes God gives the Holy Spirit to people before they are baptized to strengthen their conviction and move them to be converted."
1,130,Is anyone really so evil that he or she deserves the eternal punishment of hell? Can God not forgive those who don't believe in Him?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1345-pub.html,"Is anyone really so evil that he or she deserves the eternal punishment of hell? Can God not forgive those who donât believe in Him? God does not want to send anyone to hell. Instead, He âdesires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truthâ (1 Tim 2:4). We should not think of hell as Godâs vengeful punishment. Hell is a choice. People choose hell by rejecting the grace of God. When we sin, we choose to be separated from God, and this separation is exactly what hell isâeternal separation from God, His love, and His joy. Our very action of sinning is its own punishment: The punishment fits the crime because the punishment is the crime. Saying no to God means no God. The point is really very simple. Those who object to hellâs over-severity do not see what sin really is. They probably look at sin externally, sociologically, legalistically, as âbehaving badly.â They fail to see the real horror of sin and the real greatness and goodness and joy of the God who is refused in every sin. We all fail to appreciate this. Who of us fully appreciates Godâs beauty? The corollary immediately follows: who of us fully appreciates sinâs ugly horror? (Peter Kreeft and Ronald K. Tacelli, Handbook of Christian Apologetics [Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1994]: 300) If God makes everyone go to heaven, including those who do not want God or to be forgiven by Him, then human beings have no free choice. God doesnât force anyone to be in heaven, although His grace of forgiveness is available to all. We need to make the choice to accept this grace."
1,131,"If God loves the world and wants to save us, why did God have to come as Jesus?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1346-pub.html,"If God loves the world and wants to save us, why did God have to come as Jesus? We may have wondered if God could have used a different means to save the world. After all, if Heâs God, couldnât He have just snapped his fingers or spoken a few words to save us? However, the Bible tells us we are separated from God because of sin. The first man, Adam, was the father of humankind in a physical sense. For Adam and Eve are the first parents of humankind. All humankind came forth from Adam and Eve. After Adamâs sin, we have been cut off from God. Jesus came to reconcile us to God, i.e., He came as a mediator (1 Tim 2:5; 1 Jn 2:1; Rom 5:10) to lead us to God (1 Pet 3:18) and become his children (Mt 18:3). Second-guessing Godâs plan is foolish since there is no end to second-guessing what could have been. We could second-guess forever if we really wanted to, but that would be unproductive. In the same fashion, it is useless to ask: what if God created us with three eyes, four eyes, five eyes, etc. We could go on forever. Godâs plan is Godâs plan, that is all we really need to know. Just know the truth, we donât need to hypothesize too much on what could have been the truth. We say this not to discourage seeking after the truth (e.g., doing scientific research). But if weâve found the truth, why continue to ask further questions? If we know 2 plus 2 equals 4, why ask, âWhat if 2 plus 3 equaled 4?â As we said, Godâs ways are far beyond us and we, as humans, can never really fully understand the full essence of Godâs purpose."
1,132,How many gods are there?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1347-pub.html,"How many gods are there? There is only one true God. Monotheism (belief in one God) makes sense since there needs to be uniformity and order in the universe. Just as physical laws must carry uniformity and a smooth running machine relies on a single engineered plan, the evidence of design and uniformity in the universe depend on the existence of one God. When people talk about ""breaks"" from normal reality or natural laws, they are usually speaking about ""miracles"" or some perception of the spiritual world. Often, people feel like these miraculous or spiritual events come from some god. However, the Bible talks about many different types of spiritual beings. Many miracles and paranormal events attributed to peoplesâ extraordinary spiritual experiences can be traced to various spiritual beings. Spiritual beings, of course, include God, but they also include angels and evil spirits. The Bible is clear, however, that angels are not God and we must only worship the one true God (Rev 22:8â9). The Bible contains many passages attesting monotheism, including: The LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. (Deut 4:39; Deut 6:4). The Lord our God, the Lord is one. (Mk 12:29)"

1,135,"If we pray with faith, will God always hear our prayer?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1350-pub.html,"If we pray with faith, will God always hear our prayer?

If our prayer request is not answered immediately, we should always trust God has his good will. A trusting prayer in God is what Âpraying in faithÂ means. We should never try to force God into our own time schedule. For example, apostle Paul once asked the Lord three times for removal of a thorn in the flesh, which was a messenger of Satan (possibly a physical affliction); however, God never granted PaulÂs request. Instead, GodÂs will was to teach Paul a valuable lesson in life: that GodÂs grace is always sufficient (2 Cor 12:7Â8). Moses once prayed the Lord would allow him to cross the Jordan River, but the Lord would not grant his request (Deut 3:25, 29). Sometimes, GodÂs lessons are hard for us to swallow, for they are a bitter pill. Still, we must learn from lifeÂs harsh lessons to become stronger. Knowing this, Paul resolved to fully submitting to the Lord, saying, ÂThe will of the Lord be doneÂ (Acts 21:14)."
1,136,Why is the Lord's Prayer so important?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1351-pub.html,"Why is the Lordâs Prayer so important? We should learn the Lordâs Prayer because the Lord Jesus himself taught us to pray in this way (Mt 6:9â13; Lk 11:2â4). We must ponder its meaning, for the Lordâs Prayer is applicable to every single believerâs needs. Letâs examine the Lordâs Prayer in detail: âOur Father in heaven.â What an intimate way to greet God in our prayer! We must recognize God as our Father in heaven. God is in heaven, which is the better country Godâs people look forward to in faith (Heb 11:16). The Bible says we should realize we are merely sojourners and pilgrims in this world (1 Pet 2:11). So Peter exhorts, âAnd if you invoke as Father him who judges each one impartially according to his deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exileâ (1 Pet 1:17). If we know God is in heaven, then we should yearn to return to the home Jesus has prepared for us in heaven. And we must faithfully wait for the Lord to come again to deliver us to our new home (Jn 14:2â3). Jesus said, âI am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your Godâ (Jn 20:17). Letâs look forward to returning back to heaven with our God and Father. The use of the word âFatherâ in the Lordâs Prayer shows we must have a closeness with God. We were predestined to be adopted as Godâs children (Eph 1:5), so we also have a right to call God our Father. We must always treasure the blessing of having the right to become Godâs children (Jn 1:12; 1 Jn 3:1). The Lord Jesus was able to express his closeness to the Father, even in his times of deepest distress. Jesus, before he was to be crucified, came to the Father in sorrow and prayed, âAbba, Fatherâ¦â (Mk 14:36). âAbbaâ could be translated as âPapa.â The word shows how close Jesus counted the Lord God. But God pours out the Holy Spirit on us so that we too can cry, âAbba, Father!â (Gal 4:5â6). Still, we should know that only those who are truly born again of God can become Godâs children (Jn 1:13). Even though we have a father-son love relationship with God, we nevertheless respect and honor God. We must never take advantage of Godâs love for us. âHallowed be Your name.â Godâs name is holy and awesome (Ps 111:9). Yet many times, Godâs own people profane Godâs name (Ezek 36:20â21). There are two major reasons Godâs name may be profaned. First, Satan often incites rebellion in people, for Satan wants people to blaspheme Godâslandering Godâs name and glory (Rev 13:6; cf. Jas 2:7). Second, when Godâs people forget to watch their behavior and live according to the truth, Godâs people invite other people to slander and profane Godâs name (Zech 3:1ff; Prov 30:9; Ezek 36:16ff; 1 Tim 6:1). So Christianity often takes a bad reputation because we live hypocritical lives. We should review the song of Moses and of the Lamb, which prays Godâs name may be glorified (Rev 15:4). Every Christian must be careful to avoid being the one profaning Godâs name by being aware of the following: one, Satan may be using you to slander Godâs name; two, you may profane Godâs name because you have departed from the truth. Let us glorify, not profane, Godâs holy name. âYour kingdom come.â Godâs kingdom is also called the kingdom of heaven. Jesus began his ministry by preaching, âRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at handâ (Mt 4:17; cf. Mk 1:15). The kingdom of God was a central theme and message of Jesusâ teaching. During the forty days after Jesus resurrected, Jesus spoke about things related to Godâs kingdom (Acts 1:3). A Christianâs ultimate goal is to be saved in order to enter into Godâs eternal kingdom (2 Pet 1:11). If we only have hope for blessings in this life, then, as Christians, we are very pitiful (1 Cor 15:19). Godâs kingdom is not of this world (Jn 18:36), but itâs a heavenly kingdom under Godâs kingship, rule, and power. As Jesusâ followers, we should be praying daily for Godâs kingdom to be revealed in the world and in our lives. Godâs kingdom can also refer to the Holy Spirit (Mt 12:28). Jesus once said, âThe kingdom of God is in the midst of youâ (Lk 17:21). Jesus told us that Godâs kingdom is not a far off place. Godâs kingdom is not somewhere out there for us to laboriously search out, but Godâs kingdom is very near. We can and should manifest Godâs rule within our lives and in the midst of evil all around us. This is every good Christianâs prayer: âGod, may your kingdom come.â The Holy Spirit that indwells our hearts can help us manifest Godâs rule in our lives. Godâs kingdom must begin somewhere, and it should start with our own life. âYour will be done on earth as it is in heaven.â In heaven, Godâs will is accomplished without any obstacle, for all of Godâs angels obey Godâs word (Ps 103:20â21). On earth, however, Godâs will is often hindered by Satan (1 Thess 2:18) and/or believers who misunderstand Godâs will (Eph 5:17). But we may ask: isnât God sovereign over the earth? How can Godâs will be hindered? (Rom 9:19). First, we must distinguish hindrance from total destruction of Godâs will. Second, we should realize that in everything Godâs will does prevail. Actually, when we speak of hindering Godâs will we are speaking from a human perspective. Godâs will is never really hindered. For example, when Jonah did not go to Nineveh as God had commanded, but fled to Tarshish (Jon 1:2â3), we may feel Godâs will was hindered. But actually, Godâs will can never be hindered or destroyed. God does all things according to his will. Godâs purpose will never be changed (Heb 6:17), for no one can hold back Godâs hand (Dan 4:35). One of the most important lessons we will ever learn from life is: humans may will to do this or that, but God determines humanityâs way and time (Eccl 3:14; 9:11ff). Therefore, we who have been called by God according to Godâs purpose should recognize Godâs will (2 Tim 1:9). Therefore, we should pray for our knowledge of Godâs will to increase (Col 1:9); we must also learn to obey and accept Godâs will (Mt 7:21; Jn 4:34; Acts 21:14). Often, we know Godâs will for us but still continue in our own ways. We fail to obey Godâs will because we are weak in the spirit and our wisdom has been clouded. Since we are often weak in the flesh, we must learn the truth and strengthen ourselves in the Spirit (Jn 7:17; Rom 7:18; 8:2). âGive us this day our daily bread.â Daily bread is our daily need. To ask God for our daily need is reasonable, but to want more than what we need is going beyond the Lordâs Prayer. Godâs relationship with us is very intimate and close, so God is more than ready to provide our daily needs. The Bible tells us we are all fed by Godâs grace (Ps 104; 1 Tim 4:4â5). God knows all the needs of our life (Mt 6:8, 32). As man, male and female, we came empty-handed and will leave empty-handed. God says, â[F]or the world and all that is in it is mineâ (Ps 50:12). Therefore, we must always receive Godâs provisions with thanksgiving. Hereâs a short list of how we can experience Godâs providence: Jesus said, â[S]eek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as wellâ (Mt 6:33). The Bible tells us to work hard ourselves, we should not idly wait for Godâs providence. â[L]et him labor, doing honest work with his [i.e., a Christianâs] hands, so that he may be able to give to those in needâ (Eph 4:28). We should work to glorify God. If we sit idly, unbelievers will observe our lack of self-discipline. In being lazy and irresponsible, we put God to an open shame. God has chosen us so that we can glorify his name, so we should always do our work diligently. â[W]ork with your hands â¦ so that you may command the respect of outsiders, and be dependent on nobodyâ (1 Thess 4:11â12). Many times we cannot experience Godâs providence because we want more than what God provides. Often, like the widow that received prophet Elijah, God simply allows us the little bit we need to get by day after day (1 Kgs 17:8â16). If God gives us our daily needs, we should be content. The Bible exhorts, â[I]f we have food and clothing, with these we shall be contentâ (1 Tim 6:8; Prov 30:8â9). God will provide blessings for those who know how to give of themselves (2 Cor 9:6). âGive, and it will be given to youâ¦â (Lk 6:38). Jesus once said, when tempted by Satan, âMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of Godâ (Mt 4:4). If we recognize that Godâs providence is not merely physical, then we will go a long way in experiencing Godâs providence more and more. When we see Godâs spiritual providence, we will forget our seemingly insignificant material provisions. Jesus told the crowds that sought him for physical blessings, âDo not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his sealâ (Jn 6:27). We often toil and labor in this world for our physical blessing and comforts, but Jesus told us that there is something even more important: the eternal life that Jesus himself provides. Seek for the eternal and not the temporary. âForgive us our debts.â Our debts are our sins. God has taken pity on us in his mercy, for God loves us very much. God is willing to forgive the great debt of sin we owe to him (Mt 18:27). We know Godâs forgiveness because Jesus himself paid the price of our redemption with his blood (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor 6:20; Eph 1:14; Heb 9:15). If we have been forgiven in water baptism and by Godâs blood, why must we still ask God for forgiveness? Because we will still sin even after we are cleansed in water baptism. There are two types of sin we can recognize: first, we can sin by doing evil; second, we can sin by not doing righteousness. Both types of sin are actually two sides of the same coin, but no one can avoid any one or both of these types of sin. Even if we feel as if we are sinless because we have not done anything wrong, have we done anything good? Have we practiced Godâs righteousness? Only Jesusâ blood purifies us from all sin and forgives us of all our unrighteousness (1 Jn 1:7, 9). To abandon and leave unrighteousness is a constant struggle, even after we have believed (Rom 7:13ff). Even after we are forgiven of our past sins, we must pursue righteousness and godliness through Godâs word (2 Tim 3:15â17). âWhoever knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him it is sinâ (Jas 4:17). We should not be content with our triumph over unrighteousness. Rather, to really triumph over sin we have to zealously do the good God prepared for us to do (Eph 2:10; Tit 2:14). One who does not do the good work he can do owes a serious debt. For example, if we do not tithe (Mt 23:23; Mal 3:8), we become debtors to God. Therefore, we should humbly ask God to forgive us our debts. Still, Godâs forgiveness does not free us from the duty of doing good (Heb 10:24). Asking God to forgive our debts is to spur us to live a life worthy of the Lord and to please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work (Col 1:10). âAs we forgive our debtors.â This phrase relates back to our prayer for forgiveness examined above. Christ taught people that they must always learn to forgive one another, just as God forgave us (Mk 11:25â26; Mt 5:23â24). Since God forgave us our debts and sins against him, shouldnât we be able to forgive othersâ debts? Unless we bear one another, we cannot forgive our grievances against one another (Col 3:13). The Bible teaches us to confess our sins to each other and pray for each other (Jas 5:16). In love, we can overcome our differences and grievances with others, for love covers a multitude of sins (1 Pet 4:8). âDo not lead us into temptation.â This request in the Lordâs Prayer asks God to protect us from temptationâs draw. Temptation comes from within, for it is what draws us and causes us to sin (Jas 1:14). If we never encountered temptation, we would never be tempted to fall. But if we are surrounded by temptation, yet are never drawn to temptation, we will likewise never be tempted to fall. When Jesus was in the world, he was tempted in every way, yet without sin (Heb 4:15). Why? Because he was never drawn by temptation. Satan tempted Jesus with three temptations, but the Lord resisted all of Satanâs temptations. The Lord countered Satanâs temptation with Godâs word. Jesus told Satan: 1) Man does not only live on bread alone, but man also lives by every word of God; 2) Do not put the Lord to the test; 3) Serve and worship the Lord God alone. By holding onto Godâs word, Jesus triumphed over every fleshly temptation Satan attacked him with. Today, Satan still employs the same temptations he used on Jesus; Satan simply changes the form of his temptation. In dealing with temptation, we should follow Jesusâ example and equip ourselves with Godâs word. The three strategies we can learn from Jesus are: first, to set our mind on spiritual things; second, to always respect Godâs authority and position; third, to always seek to worship and serve God in everything we do. If these three things can become part of our lives, we will surely overcome Satanâs schemes. So we pray to God: do not to lead us into temptation. If we always pray for Godâs deliverance and keep ourselves aware of temptation, we will surely triumph over temptation. God is faithful, when we are tempted, he will provide a way out so that we can withstand (1 Cor 10:13). Peter tells us, â[T]he Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trialâ (2 Pet 2:9). âDeliver us from the evil one.â We should pray that God always deliver us from evil (the evil one) of this world. For example, when Paul was persecuted for preaching the gospel, he said, âSo I was rescued from the lionâs mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evilâ¦â (2 Tim 4:17â18). King Solomon, in the book of Ecclesiastes, tells us that one of the sad things about life is the evil we will encounter in this world. The earth is often corrupted with sin and full of violence. Natural disasters can happen in quick succession. But as if natural disasters werenât enough, human beings themselves bring disaster upon humankind. We pollute the environment. We develop weapons of mass destruction. The list goes on. And as Christians, we may face the evil of trying to live a godly life in a godless age. Those who want to live godly in Jesus Christ will often suffer persecution (2 Tim 3:12). Jesus said, â[T]he world hates youâ (Jn 15:19). He also said, âIn the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the worldâ (Jn 16:33). Paul said, âBut the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from evilâ (2 Thess 3:3). âFor Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amenâ (Mt 6:9ff). (Note: Some ancient texts omit this part of the Lordâs Prayer, so it may not be in your Bible except as a footnote; cf. Lk 11:2ff.) The last part of the Lordâs prayer praises God, much like David praised God (1 Chr 29:10â13). The kingdom, authority, and glory of God lasts forever. We are all citizens of Godâs kingdom (Phil 3:20) and we will reign with Christ and God in the future (Rev 20:6; 22:5). We shall be glorified in Godâs kingdom (Heb 2:10; Rom 8:30). And we will be with the Lord forever. âAmenâ is a Hebrew saying meaning âtrueâ or âsincere.â The Greek equivalent also means âtrueâ (Rev 3:14). The word âamenâ is used to emphasize the prayerâs truth and sincerity. It is often used to ask God to âmake it soâ or to emphasize to others âmay it be so.â"
1,137,Heaven is such a remote idea. Why talk about something so far from reality when there are enough things in this life to worry about?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1352-pub.html,"Heaven is such a remote idea. Why talk about something so far from reality when there are enough things in this life to worry about? Our life on earth is not detached from our eternal destiny. Our earthly tasks reflect what we believe to be our ultimate goal. If you set your goal on something false, you will waste your entire life on meaningless pursuits. That is why you need to find out whether there is heaven. If heaven is real, then we have to orient our daily live to this goal. Belief in heaven actually makes a direct, positive impact in this life. Believers who look forward to heaven bring blessings to others because they obey Godâs command to love others as themselves. While Godâs promises may pertain to the life to come, Godâs commandments are for this life, not the afterlife. Our belief in heaven does not detract from our present responsibilities. On the contrary, it motivates us to make a difference on earth."

As soon as Jesus was baptized, He came out of the water. At that very moment heaven was opened, and the Spirit of God descended on Jesus like a dove. Then a voice from heaven said, âThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleasedâ (Mt 3:16â17)."
1,139,"What was Jesus"" body like after his resurrection?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1354-pub.html,"What was Jesusâ body like after his resurrection? Jesus resurrected in a spiritual body. We understand this because physical barriers no longer confined his actions. Also, the analogy between Jesusâ resurrection and Christian baptism tells us we are sown a natural body and raised a spiritual body (1 Cor 15:44). The Bible narrates the events surrounding the resurrection: âJesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midstâ (Jn 20:19, 26). âHe vanished out of their sightâ (Lk 24:31). However, we donât really know what type of spiritual body Jesus had. The Bible says Jesus had bones and flesh. So in some sense, he was tangible and could eat and speak like a normal person (Lk 24:39, 43). Jesusâ resurrection was not the result of an âundying spirit,â that never dies. To put Jesus in that category would mean Jesusâ body died and only his spirit resurrected. The Bible is clear that his body rose from death and transformed into a âglorious bodyâ (Phil 3:21; Acts 2:31). Unfortunately, we donât understand what type of body Jesus had really well, except that it was a spiritual body capable of being tangible with flesh and bone."
1,141,Why must baptism be performed with head bowed and face downward?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1356-pub.html,"Why must baptism be performed with head bowed and face downward? In Romans 6:3-4, Paul states that believers are âburied with Christ through baptism into death.â We are âunited together in the likeness of His death,â so that we have the assurance that we shall also be united âin the likeness of His resurrectionâ (Rom 6:5). The manner of baptism during biblical times was in the likeness of the Lordâs death. Paul uses this physical likeness in baptism to discuss the spiritual likeness that believers carry. John 19:30 describes the physical likeness of Jesusâ death: âbowing His head, He gave up His spirit.â It is on this basis that we understand to what the physical likeness of the Lordâs death refers. In the Bible, bowing oneâs head expresses the disgrace and heaviness of sin (Ps 40:12; Lk 18:13; Job 10:15). Just as Christ died to sin once for all, we also die to sin so that sin should no longer have power over us (Rom 6:2,10). As we bow our heads and are immersed in water, our sinful self dies and is buried with Christ. As we rise from the water, we are raised with Christ and receive a new life in Him (Rom 6:4; Col 2:12)."
1,142,Can we experience the Holy Spirit?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1357-pub.html,"Can we experience the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is formless and shapeless; Jesus told us the Holy Spirit cannot be seen (Jn 14:17). How then do we come to accept the existence of an invisible Holy Spirit? Jesus told us about the experience of the Spiritâs power and existence. Jesus once said, âThe wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spiritâ (Jn 3:8). Jesus once breathed on his disciples and said, âReceive the Holy Spiritâ (Jn 20:22). Jesusâ comments on the Spirit show that when the Holy Spirit descends on someone, they will know and feel it. Unfortunately, many evangelical Christian churches today feel the Holy Spirit comes silently when we believe, or that the Holy Spirit silently stayed with the church after Pentecost."
1,143,Wasn't Jesus just a prophet or teacher?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1358-pub.html,"Wasnât Jesus just a prophet or teacher? Suppose someone walked up to you and said, âI am the way, the truth, and the life. I am not just a messenger of God, but God Himself! Besides me, there is no other way to heaven.â Would you take him to be just another moral teacher? Jesus taught about the kingdom of God and the right way to live. He prophesied about His death, His resurrection, as well as the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. But He was also more than a prophet or a teacher. Buddha, Mohammed, or Confucius never claimed they were God. But those who witnessed Jesusâ life, His death, and His prophesied resurrection realized that what He claimed was true. No other prophet or teacher in the history of the world has risen from the dead. Jesus Christ is the living God. And because He is alive, we can also experience Him working in our lives today."
1,144,"How does Jesus"" resurrection relate to his followers?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1359-pub.html,"How does Jesusâ resurrection relate to his followers? Jesusâ resurrection is at the heart of the gospel messageâa crucial step in Godâs redemption plan. God obviously plays a vital role in our salvation. So we should firmly follow the Bibleâs instructions on the way to salvation (1 Cor 15:1â2). If Jesus never resurrected after he died, believing in him would essentially be worthless. How can you get eternal life from someone who canât even overcome death himself? Had Jesus remained dead, we who die would perish with no hope for any life to come. So the Bible tells us Jesusâ followers would be the most pitiful of all people if Jesus never resurrected (1 Cor 15:17, 19). Resurrection doesnât just mean we live a new life or change our bad ways, but on the last day our physical body will actually resurrect or be transformed into a spiritual body (1 Cor 15:51â53; Jn 6:40)."
1,145,Can we completely know God through evidence of God's existence?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1360-pub.html,"Can we completely know God through evidence of Godâs existence? The evidence we discussed above may convince us God exists, yet we must be humbly willing to open up ourselves to the truth. Without a willingness to believe there will be no belief. A stubborn heart is difficult to convince. God is hidden and we do need to exercise faith to believe in Him. Our faith is not an unthinking blind faith in something totally absurd, however, believing in God does take a measure of humility. The Bible tells us God gives grace to the humble. The Bible says the pure in heart shall see God. We know God through revelation of Himself to us. The Bible says God calls us, not the other way around, i.e., we call God. So how do we come to a point of believing in God? God leads us to the point, whether we realize this or not. So if God is revealed by revelation of Himself, we may wonder: why hasnât God revealed Himself to me yet? Because God waits for you to take a step in his direction, then God will reveal Himself. This is why we continually emphasize: it takes some faith and openness to seek the truth and find the truth. God will not, we repeat, will not reveal Himself to someone who is stubborn in his belief there is no God. The evidence of Godâs existence is believable to those who are willing to believe; yet, it makes no sense at all to those who are not willing to make sense of it. God has given evidence of Himself so that people can seek Him, reach out to Him, and find Him (Acts 17:27), but people are often unwilling to take the first step. Humankind is only a tiny speck compared to the whole universe (Isa 40:15, 17), while God is higher than the heavens, that is, beyond all our understanding (Job 36:26; 11:7). What we now know of God is limited (1 Cor 13:12), for people will never know God by their own human wisdom. Only through Godâs revelation and pondering the evidence of creation can we press on to know Him (Hos 6:3), to truly know Him (Eph 1:17), to know more and more about Him (Col 1:9)."
1,146,Who is Jesus?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1361-pub.html,"Who is Jesus? Jesus is God Himself, the Word of life, who is from the very beginning. The Bible says the Word (Jesus) was with God, and the Word was God (Jn 1:1). The Word became flesh and was born as the man Jesus Christ, who was called the âSon of manâ (Mt 16:13). Jesus is Godâs beloved Son (Mt 3:17). He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. All things were created by Jesus for Jesus (Col 1:15â17). Jesus is the Savior of humankind, for He was born to the world for that very purpose (Lk 2:11â12)."
1,147,What is God?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1362-pub.html,"What is God? Since we canât see God, people often feel as if God doesnât exist. The Bible says only fools say there is no God (Ps 14:1). The reason we canât see God is because God is Spirit (Jn 4:24). But even though we donât see God, God is the source and reason of our existence, whether we recognize this fact or not (Rom 11:35â36). God is unique from other creations, which is an important distinction (Isa 40:18, 25). Never confuse the Creator with the created. God fills the universe and gives life and breath to all things living (Col 1:17â20; Acts 17:25, 28; cf. Eph 1:23). Since God is Spirit, He is not restricted to certain physical locations, like Jerusalem or some sacred temple (Acts 17:24). We might think, âIf God is everywhere then isnât God everything?â Pantheists say, âEverything is God.â But God is not everything, He fills the earth and is Spirit. As human beings, we are limited in how much we know about spiritual things. However, the Bible clearly tells us we are not God, and we ourselves experience we are not God. While we often think we control our destiny, tragedies wake us up to reality. The proud often have to be humbled by their tragedies to realize Godâs sovereignty. We do not control the future or the many events in our life. The Bible tells us Godâs hand controls life and death (Deut 32:39), which is to tell us God controls our destiny."
1,148,What about infants and children?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1363-pub.html,"What about infants and children? Infants and children are born with sin (Ps 51:5), so they also need to be born again. The promise of baptism for the remission of sins is also given to the children (Acts 2:38-39). Children were never excluded from Godâs covenant with his people (Gen 17:9-14). Therefore, we must not forbid children from receiving salvation since the Lord Jesus Himself does not reject little children (see Lk 18:15-17). We can also see that in the early church, entire households were baptized (Acts 16:15, 32-34; 18:8; 1Cor 1:16). In the Old Testament, the entire household, including children and infants, crossed the Red Sea (Ex 10:9-10, 24; 12:31). Children and infants were not left in the land of bondage. Crossing the Red Sea prefigures the New Testament baptism (1Cor 10:1-2). So in the same way, children and infants must also be baptized to be cleanse of their sins and be released from the bondage of Satan. Children were healed of their diseases through their parentsâ faith (Mt 15:28). By the same token, children and infants may be baptized based on the faith of their parents (Jn 4:49-51). We must also keep in mind, however, that it is the grace of God and the cross of Christ, not the conscious choice of humans, that gives baptism its effect. So even if children cannot make a conscious choice to receive Godâs grace, they should not be excluded from Godâs grace."
1,149,"What good would Jesus"" charity do for people?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1364-pub.html,"What good would Jesusâ charity do for people? Jesusâ charity satisfied the physical and spiritual needs of many people. The body is temporary, but the soul is eternal. What we donât see is more important than what we do see. Jesus cared for and healed the sick. He drove out demons and raised the deadâhealing people to a spiritual wholeness. Jesusâ work was done not for the sake of healing itself, but to draw people to spiritual progress and faith in him. Therefore, all the good Jesus did was mainly for the purpose of fulfilling and saving people spiritually. The following lists some of Jesusâ blessings: Peace (Lk 1:79; Mk 5:34; Lk 7:50; Jn 14:27; 16:33; Phil 4:7; Col 3:15). Freedom (Jn 8:36; Lk 13:16; Rom 8:1â2; Gal 5:1, 13; 2 Cor 3:17).

1,150,Why would a good God allow suffering?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1365-pub.html,"Why would a good God allow suffering? Goodness is not equivalent to kindness, for ""if goodness meant only kindness, a God who tolerated pain in his creatures when he could abolish it would not be an all-good God"" (Peter Kreeft and Ronald K. Tacelli, Handbook of Christian Apologetics [Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1994], 140). Because His nature is perfectly good and just, however, God cannot tolerate sin. Having sinned and turned away from God, we are subject to His divine wrath. And since our souls are alienated from God, our bodies, too, are alienated and no longer under His protection. God gave humankind authority over nature (Gen 1:28), but when humanity rejected Godâs authority, we rejected the authority He gave us. Therefore we suffer both physical evil from the natural world (disease, famine, earthquakes) as well as moral evil from the sins we commit (hatred, envy, deceit). Yet the suffering of this world is only temporary for those who put their trust in God. If we believe in Jesus, one day our imperfect bodies will rise to enter into that perfect kingdom He has prepared. There, ""He will wipe every tear from our eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain"" (Rev 21:4)."

We cannot live apart from the world; Jesus commanded us to go into it, and be the light of the world: âA city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstandâ (Mt 5:14-15). The important point is not to let worldly influences dim or overshadow our light. Believers can and should associate with nonbelievers, so long as their faith in God is unaffected and their relationship with God remains the top priority. After all, He has called us to âshine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heavenâ (Mt 5:16)."
1,152,Did God prepare for humankind's salvation?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1367-pub.html,"Did God prepare for humankindâs salvation? Yes. The Bible says God prepared salvation in Jesus Christ before the beginning of time (2 Tim 1:9). Hebrews says God spoke to his chosen people through the prophets in the past, at many times and in various ways; however, in the last days (last days may mean the era after Christ came) he spoke to us through his Son, Jesus Christ (Heb 1:1â2). The prophets searched intently and questioned within themselves when Jesus Christ would come. In fact, even angels long to look into matters related to humankindâs salvation (1 Pet 1:10, 12). We could say the salvation of humankind is like a great love storyâso interesting to watch unravel, even angels desire to look into it. Salvation is a great thing, for salvation concerns you in particular and all people in general (Lk 1:49; 2:10). Isnât it wonderful that God prepared salvation for everyone? (Lk 2:31)."

Sometimes, out of self-interested motives, we try to deceive God. However, God cannot be deceived. Ananias and Sapphira, two early Christian church members, died when they tried to deceive the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3).&amp;nbsp; Disrespecting the Holy Spirit. Believers have received so much grace and truth from the Holy Spirit. However, if after we have received Godâs grace and truth, we continue in our sins, we disrespect Jesus, Jesusâ blood, and the Holy Spirit (Heb 10:29).&amp;nbsp; Blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. Some people call the Holy Spiritâs work and gifts the devilâs work (Mk 3:28â30). These people refer to Godâs work as Satanâs work because they are ignorant of Godâs intentions and ways. Jesus told us that a very serious mortal sin (sin which leads to death) and is not forgiven is to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit (Mt 12:31â32).&amp;nbsp;"

It is clear that being born of the Spirit is essential for salvation. From other parts of the Scripture, we also see that receiving the Holy Spirit is a requisite for salvation. For example, Titus 3:5 states that we are saved by the washing of rebirth and the renewal of the Holy Spirit; in Titus 3:6 it explains that this Holy Spirit has been poured out on us generously. Similarly, Ephesians 1:13 says that believers have been marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit (i.e., received the promised Holy Spirit), who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance. So to be born of the Spirit does indeed refer to receiving the Holy Spirit, which is necessary for salvation."
1,156,Why did Jesus have to die for us?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1371-pub.html,"Why did Jesus have to die for us? Shedding blood has long been considered a way to atone for sins. This principle of atoning for our sins by shedding blood crosses cultural and racial boundaries. The Bible is in line with this principle, saying the following: âWithout the shedding of blood there is no remissionâ (Heb 9:22). Jesus âloves us and has freed us from our sins by his bloodâ (Rev 1:5). We have been âbrought near in the blood of Christâ (Eph 2:13). We have been âjustified by His bloodâ (Rom 5:9). âWe have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesusâ (Heb 10:19). We overcome Satan by Jesusâ blood (Rev 12:11). Jesus, a sinless person, had to take the place of and die for every sinner in Godâs eyes. In Godâs eyes, we are all sinners, so God had to come as Jesus to die for everyone. It is the church that is covered by Jesusâ shed blood."

He searched for and saved the lost (Lk 19:10). From these verses we catch a glimpse of the man Jesus was. We see Jesus rarely lost his temper, and when he did it was usually dealing with hypocrisy or some obstruction to Godâs work. Jesus seemed to especially look to the hopeless and lost to give hope and direction."
1,158,Can we choose another day to celebrate Christ's birth?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1373-pub.html,"Can we choose another day to celebrate Christâs birth? Neither the celebration of Christmas nor Jesusâ birthday are recorded in the Bible. So at least from a biblical perspective, Christmas celebrations are not recommended or demanded. But does that mean Christmas celebrations are disapproved? Look at this from Jesusâ perspective, since it is his supposed birthday. Would you like someone celebrating your birthday if you didnât want them to? What if they wanted to celebrate it on a day you werenât even born? And what if the very origins of the day people celebrated your birthday was to honor another person who you didnât like much? Is that how we should honor Jesusâ birth? As we examined, Jesus is God. Jesus said, âBefore Abraham was, I amâ (Jn 8:58). âThe LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old. â (Prov 8:22). God became flesh (1 Tim 3:16) and lived among us (Jn 1:14). Since Jesus is actually God, without beginning or end, there is no need to celebrate Christmas to honor his birth. For the most part, people only celebrate Christmas to get presents for themselves; but, Christians should give to others every day in more ways than one (i.e., in material gifts)."

How can the water during baptism actually remove a person's sins? The apostle John bears witness that blood and water flowed from Jesus' side (Jn 19:34). In 1 John 5:6, he explains that Jesus did not come by water only (here the water refers to baptism; notice water is mentioned first), but by water and blood, and that it is the Spirit who testifies. In other words, the effect of Jesus' blood, by the testimony of the Holy Spirit, is present during baptism to cleanse the sin of the person being baptized. Although the candidate's body is immersed physically in water, yet the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses his spiritual being (Heb 10:22; ""washed"" = immersed). The baptisms performed in the True Jesus Church, during which many have witnessed blood in the water, confirm John's explanation."

The Jewish nation, ruled by Rome, would go through many wars and other trials. The Jewish nation would eventually go into decline. During Jesusâ time, Jewish nationals, who loved the Jewish nation and wanted to preserve Jewish religion, hoped Israel would one day be revived (Acts 1:6). Some may have taken a revolutionary stance, but the âzealotsâ are now believed not to have formed until years after Jesus died. However, even in Jesusâ time there was a tension between Jewish and pagan cultures. Many wealthy urban types went with the flow of pagan culture. However, many Jews were indignant to the encroaching pagan culture. The differences in thought and the grasping for power among the Jewish people resulted in an often chaotic, hypocritical, and deceitful social environment. Jesus once sighed, âWhen the Son of man comes, will He find really faith on earth?â (Lk 18:8). Jesus was not one to play along with the games of popular politics. From time to time, Jesus would denounce the crooked and depraved leaders of the people. Jesus saw how hard the hearts of people had become. He understood morality and righteousness was often compromised in his time. People then, much like today, were often indifferent to justice and mercy. The parable of the Good Samaritan illustrates Jesusâ concern over the peoplesâ compassion for one another and tense social relations (Lk 10:31â34). People had become self-centered and unfeeling. Jesus once told a parable illustrating the hardness of the times, saying the people were like children who complain to their friends, âWe played the flute for you, And you did not dance; We mourned to you, And you did not lament â (Mt 11:17)."
1,164,What blessings does the Holy Spirit give to the disciples?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1379-pub.html,"What blessings does the Holy Spirit give to the disciples?

Setting a seal of redemption on us. âIn Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promiseâ (Eph 1:13). â[T]he Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemptionâ (Eph 4:30). âGod, who also has given us the Spirit as a guaranteeâ (2 Cor 5:5). Setting believers free. âFor the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death â (Rom 8:2). âNow the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertyâ (2 Cor 3:17). Anointing believers with the Holy Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit counsels us and gives us wisdom. â[T]he anointing which you received from him abides in youâ (1Jn 2:27). âBut the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to youâ (Jn 14:26). âHe who is spiritual judges all thingsâ (1Cor 2:15). Strengthening us spiritually. âThat He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner manâ (Eph 3:16). âIf you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon youâ (1 Pet 4:14). Having the power to testify. âBut you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Meâ¦â (Acts 1:8). âAnd my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human[1] wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of powerâ (1Cor 2:4). Having a fruitful spirituality. âBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no lawâ (Gal 5:22â23). âbut we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoptionâ¦â (Rom 8:23). Helping us reach the depths of spiritual prayer. âPraying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spiritâ (Jude 20). âPray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplicationâ (Eph 6:18). âThe Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. â (Rom 8:26). âFor if I pray in a tongue, my spirit praysâ¦â (1 Cor 14:14). Giving believers spiritual gifts. âThere are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. â¦ But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills(1 Cor 12:4,11). Giving comfort. âThat you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit â (Rom 15:13).

Paul writes, âYet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongueâ (1 Cor 14:19). Paul is referring to preaching (prophecy) in tongues, not prayer in tongues. When there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet and âspeak to himself and to Godâ (1 Cor 14:28). Thus, Paul discourages preaching in tongues without interpretation but never discourages praying in tongues during service (see 1 Cor 14:39) Paul says that âGod is not the author of confusion but of peaceâ because during church service in Corinth, the members would preach in tongues even when there was no interpreter and many would speak at once (see 1 Cor 14:27-30). All this caused confusion and disorder. Prayer in tongues is directed to God and needs no interpretation (1 Cor 14:2). When everyone prays in tongues during church service, there is no confusion nor disorder. Rather, there is a spirit of unity."

God raised Jesus from the dead (Acts 2:32; 1 Cor 6:14), for Jesus is the author of life (Acts 3:15). Jesus once said, âI have power to lay it [my life] down, and I have power to take it againâ (Jn 10:18). He also said, âI am the resurrection and the lifeâ (Jn 11:25). It was impossible for death to keep its hold over Jesus (Acts 2:24). Death was swallowed up by his resurrection (Isa 25:8; 1 Cor 15:26). Eternal life was revealed through Jesus (2 Tim 1:10). These are some of the many verses that show the significance of Jesusâ resurrection lies in Jesusâ power and authority over death. Sin, which results in death, was dealt a severe blow by Jesusâ atoning death. So Jesus essentially opened up the way to eternal life."
1,170,Isn't Christ the end of the law? Why should Christians today still observe the law by keeping the Sabbath?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1385-pub.html,"Isn?t Christ ?the end of the law?? Why should Christians today still observe the law by keeping the Sabbath? â Christ did not abolish the commandments In Romans 10:4, Paul discusses how the Jews try to establish their own righteousness by observing the law rather than submitting to Godâs righteousness. The passage teaches us that a person is justified by believing in Christ, not by keeping the law. Yet Paul is not saying that Christ did away with the law or Godâs commandments. Christ Himself stated that He did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it (Mt 5:17-20). The Sabbath is mentioned at least 64 times in the New Testament, and in every instance it refers to the seventh day, with no intimation that it had ceased to be of binding obligation. Jesus Christ sacredly observed the seventh day and taught His followers to do the same: So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. (Lk 4:16) Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths. (Lk 4:30-31) As this was His âcustom,â it follows that the Sabbath day found Jesus habitually in the synagogue, engaged in divine worship. He ever upheld the Sabbath and the Sabbath law. Concerning the law of God, of which the Sabbath commandment is a part, He said: For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law, till all is fulfilled. (Mt 5:18) The Lord Jesus Christ is our perfect role model. He leaves us examples so that we can follow in His steps (1 Pet 2:21). â We keep the Sabbath under grace, not under the law. We do not keep the Sabbath in order to earn our own righteousness. We do it as Godâs children, out of obedience to Godâs commandments, under the grace of Jesus Christ. Remember, it is where your heart is that determines whether or not you are keeping the Sabbath under grace or under the law. For example, if you have to work on the Sabbath and cannot go to church, the Lord knows your heart and your desire to be in His temple. If you do not have to work, but instead choose to go fishing, here too, He knows your heart. We shall be given our just reward according to our heartsâ desires."

In Hebrew, Jesus is Joshua, which means âthe Lord is the Savior.â Jesus is Godâs name (Mt 1:21; Isa 9:6), for by no other name can we be saved (Acts 4:12). Christ is not Jesusâ last name. Christ is derived from a Greek term, which means âMessiahâ or âanointed oneâ in Hebrew. Christ is a title not a name, designating the fact God anointed Jesus for a purpose. In ancient times, Hebrew kings, prophets, and priests were anointed before they were consecrated to perform their respective roles. Christ is Godâs anointed one, King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev 19:16; Jn 18:37)."

Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners and to reveal Godâs love (1 Jn 4:9â10). Out of His great love for us, God manifested Himself as a human being in order to save us, so He may be crucified on our behalf (Phil 2:6â8). No one has ever seen God, but Jesus makes God known to us, as He is God himself (Jn 1:18). Today, we can be saved by believing in Jesus Christ (Acts 16:30â31)."

The purpose for believing in Jesus is to âbelong to Christ.â â[Y]ou are Christâs; and Christ is Godâsâ (1 Cor 3:23). âFor whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, assuredly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his rewardâ (Mk 9:41). These verses show the importance of belonging to Christ. âNow if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not Hisâ (Rom 8:9). To have the Holy Spirit is to be âsealed for the day of redemptionâ (Eph 4:30). The seal of the Holy Spirit means the Lord knows those who are his (2 Tim 2:19). Without the Holy Spiritâs seal, we are like the foolish virgins in Jesusâ parable of the ten virgins who carried lamps without oil. Without oil (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), we cannot shine (manifest Godâs glory). In the last days, the Lord will tell those of us without oil (the Holy Spirit), âI do not know youâ (Mt 25:12). So we must receive the Holy Spirit after we believe in Jesus."
1,176,Do believers need to pray for the Holy Spirit?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1391-pub.html,"Do believers need to pray for the Holy Spirit? While it is the promise of God, receiving the Holy Spirit requires prayer and asking on our part. Luke 11:13 and John 4:10 clearly illustrate this point. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit is also contingent upon the obedience of the Lordâs instructions (Mt 28:20; Acts 5:32). Praying for the Holy Spirit does not deny the authority of God; instead, it is a natural expression of our faith (Mt 15:22-28; Rom 10:14), earnestness (Lk 11:5-8), and persistence (Lk 18:1-8). The Lord Jesus told the disciples of the importance of receiving the Holy Spirit and specifically instructed them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Holy Spirit (Lk 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8). The disciples themselves must have been eager to receive the Holy Spirit; that is why they prayed constantly. The only logical conclusion was that they were praying for the Holy Spirit."

Did Jesus have any brothers or sisters? Yes, according to Matthew 13:56, Jesus had four brothers and several sisters. While Jesusâ brothers did not believe in Him during His public ministry (Jn 7:5), they came to believe after His resurrection. James, one of Jesusâ brothers, later became a leader in the church and the author of the epistle that bears his name. Judas, or Jude, is believed to be the author of the epistle of Jude. Yet Jesus also said that whoever does the will of His Father in heaven is His brother, sister, or mother (Mt 12:48-50)."
1,178,Where does God live?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1393-pub.html,"Where does God live? God âdwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can seeâ (1 Tim 6:16; Job 9:11; 23:3; Ex 33:20; Heb 11:27). The Bible tells us God lives in âheavenâ (Heb 9:24; Ps 123:1; Mt 6:9). Isaiah says God is above all the stars (Isa 14:13), while angels proclaim He is in the highest (Lk 2:14). However, saying God lives in heaven does not mean He is not on earth. God is Spirit and is above a simple material understanding. Being a Spirit, God is in all things (Ps 139:7â8), so we cannot confine God in time or space. As the Bible says, God fills heaven and earth (Jer 23:23â24)."
1,179,How should I be baptized?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1394-pub.html,"How should I be baptized? The definition of baptism denotes how and where you should be baptized: immersion in living water. The way a person is baptized carries great spiritual significance. We bow our heads in baptism in the likeness of His death, to signify dying with Christ. Full immersion signifies the complete burial of the old self. In addition to this spiritual significance, baptism in the correct manner actually results in the effect of death and burial of the old self and the resurrection of the new person (Rom 6:3-5; Col 2:12). The baptism of salvation has the spiritual power to cleanse sins. Water baptism is thus different from the traditional ablution of the Jews or proselyte baptism. It is not a mere ritual. It must be performed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because a person is baptized into Christ, who forgives sins through baptism (Gal 3:27; Acts 2:38). Ephesians 4:5 points out that there is &amp;quot;one Lord, one faith, one baptism.&amp;quot; All true believers must believe in the same Lord, hold the same faith, and receive the same baptism. It is important to know what the Bible says about how one should be baptized. We also follow the examples that the Lord Jesus and the disciples set."
1,180,Did Jesus die for Jews (God's chosen people) or all people?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1395-pub.html,"Did Jesus die for Jews (Godâs chosen people) or all people? Jesus died for the sins of the whole world (1 Jn 2:2). He was delivered to die on a tree for our sins (1 Pet 2:24), and becoming a curse for us (Gal 3:13â14). Isaiah clearly prophesied, âSurely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and by his stripes we are healedâ (Isa 53:4â5). While the Bible is often directed towards Godâs people Israel and the Jews, the Bible makes it clear Jesus died to save the whole world of sinners, which includes everyone. Jesusâ death is intimately related to every personâs salvation. So let us humbly accept Jesus as our personal Savior."
1,181,What important messages are found in the gospel?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1396-pub.html,"What important messages are found in the gospel?

Yet, Jesus was the Savior of His people. Jesus?salvation succeeds in five ways as a source of our salvation. The following has been done for us, and this is at the heart of Jesus?gospel: Christ was born for us. âFor there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord""(Lk 2:11). Christ died for us. âChrist died for our sins according to the Scriptures""(1 Cor 15:3; Rom 5:8). Christ resurrected for us. He was âwas raised because of our justification""(Rom 4:25). Christ ascended into heaven for us. âI go to prepare a place for you"" (Jn 14:2?). Christ will come again for us. He will âappear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation"" (Heb 9:28). These five points are basic Christian beliefs and are guiding principles out of which come all the derivatives of the gospel. However, donât confuse this with a belief that these are the only things we need to know for salvation. The Bible is a big book with lots of things to learn about salvation."

The Lord taught, &amp;quot;In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

1,183,How can we know God exists?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1398-pub.html,"How can we know God exists? How can we know God exists? From Creation If something exists, it has either 1) always existed, 2) been created by something that always existed, or 3) created itself. We know from evidence that the universe has not always existed. We also know that it is impossible for something finite to create itself. It would have to exist in order to create; but how can something be and not be at the same time? Therefore, the only option remaining is the universe was created by something that has always existed, has infinite might and eternal life. The Bible tells us that ""since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead"" (Rom 1:20). When we see a tree, we realize that there was once a seed from which it grew. When we see a child, we recognize that there were parents that gave birth to the child. When we consider the universe, we know there must be a source for its being: Existence is like a gift given from cause to effect. If there is no one who has the gift, the gift cannot be passed down the chain of receivers, however long or short the chain may be... If there is no God who has existence by His own eternal nature, then the gift of existence cannot be passed down the chain of creatures and we can never get it. But we do get it; we exist. Therefore there must exist a God: an Uncaused Being.&amp;#185; We are able to exist today because there are complex forces, systems and structures working in the universe, keeping it in order. The earth sustains life because it is located at just the right distance from the sun, between the thermally uninhabitable limits of the boiling and freezing points of water. We live because each cell of our bodies possesses about 80,000 genes that enable the trillions of cells we have to function and communicate with each other. From the macro world to the micro, we see both precision and complexity, but above all, purpose, in existence. Nudge the earth a little off its path of orbit, and the temperature would cause all of life to die; alter or remove a gene, and the whole body may be destroyed. Such explicit design declares the existence of an intelligent creator. From His Word God has revealed His existence and His plans for humankind through His own word. The existence of the Bible and its lasting influence over thousands of years attest to something greater than the invention of man. Indeed, how could over forty authors, from peasants to kings, statesmen to fishermen, and over a span of forty generations have presented such a consistent image of God and message of His divine plan unless His existence were real? Accumulated evidence has demonstrated the truth of the Word: not only through corroborating archaeological findings&amp;#178;, but also through the fulfillment of over 600 specific, biblical prophecies through the ages&amp;#179; and its ultimate materialization in Jesus Christ (Jn 1:1,14). From Human Consciousness God exists because we know and experience Him. The book of Romans tells us that humans ""knew God"" but ""suppress the truth in unrighteousness"" (Rom 1:21,18). And yet an underlying moral consciousness, a universal sense of right and wrong, persists within us, testifying to that ultimate source of justice. Though laws may vary across boundaries and ""values"" are subjective, there are universally accepted notions of how one ought (e.g. with honor, kindness) or ought not (e.g. murder, rape, lie) to behave that have prevailed through history and across cultural boundaries. Fundamentally, or at the very least, we recognize the obligation to obey our conscience&amp;#151an obligation that neither arises from nature nor ourselves, nor society, for none of the three can fully ""impose"" that obligation on us. The only source for the absolute moral obligation to obey our conscience is God. The universal desire, found among people in every age and culture, to seek out and worship God also affirms his existence. Why would the desire exist if there were no real object for it? We would not feel hunger or thirst unless food and water existed. As C.S. Lewis argued in Mere Christianity, ""If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."" A person might win a million dollars, achieve a certain level of fame, or gain the affection of others, but still seek something better that he knows exists ""out there."" The fulfillment, the perfect goodness, the complete love we long for truly exists; the delusion occurs when we fail to recognize we are really missing God. From Experience Our knowledge of God, however, is not only based on inference. We can know he exists through experience. God does directly intervene in our lives, as testimony reveals. When we hear about a person healed from a fatal illness, or a baby found sleeping, cradled in the limb of a tree, after a tornado, we recognize that certain incidents cannot be rationally explained. There must be someone beyond our ""ordinary,"" ""rational"" world who has control over it: there must be God. When we practice Godâs word, we will see the results. When we pray, as he instructed us, God listens and answers our prayers, even in miraculous ways. If we pray for the Holy Spirit, we will receive it, as many believers can testify&amp;#151;truly experiencing the power and joy in the spirit as the Bible describes. Moreover, when we receive the Holy Spirit, we experience the guiding presence of God daily (Ezek 36:27). Peter Kreeft and Ronald K. Tacelli, Handbook of Christian Apologetics (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1994), 51. For a measured look at current archaeological evidence, see Jeffery L. Sheler, ""Is the Bible true?""

1,185,How did death come into this world?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1400-pub.html,"How did death come into this world? God told the first man, Adam, that he and Eve could not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, or else they would die. Adam and Eve chose instead to listen to Satan, the tempter. They disobeyed Godâs specific command, so sin entered the world, and death with it (Rom 5:12). Death and sin go hand in hand: the cause of death is sin (Rom 6:23). Sin separates us from God, who is holy. Apart from Him who is the source of life, we no longer have His eternal life in us. Our bodies are mortal, and our spirits, because of sin, are condemned to eternal death."
1,186,How did Jesus die?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1401-pub.html,"How did Jesus die? Jesus died by crucifixion, a brutal form of capital punishment by the Romans. Jesus spoke his last words on the cross, saying, âIt is finished,â meaning his work was accomplished. In the spiritual realm, finishing his work on earth meant Godâs work was guaranteed. In the spiritual realm there is no space and time as we understand it. So Jesus bowed his head and gave up his spirit (Jn 19:30). One of the soldiers pierced Jesusâ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water (Jn 19:34). The blood and water opened up the fountain for the forgiveness of sins. In Christian terms, those who are baptized can be forgiven of their sins through Jesusâ blood."
1,187,What is the role of the members?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1402-pub.html,"What is the role of the members? Like a family, the church provides the church provides for the spiritual needs of her members. The Holy Spirit distributes various gifts and abilities to the members so that they may serve and encourage one another (1 Cor 12:4-11). As members of the family, we need to work together using our God-given abilities to help each other grow. The spirit of unity and mutual support is the guiding principle of the church. Having the love and grace of our Lord as our common bond, we share together the joy, peace, and strength in Christ."
1,188,Where was Jesus born and where did he grow up?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1403-pub.html,"Where was Jesus born and where did he grow up? Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judah (Lk 2:4), which is the city of David. Joseph and Mary left Nazareth and went to Bethlehem to be registered in a Roman census. Later, Jesusâ parents returned to Nazareth, where Jesus grew up (Mt 2:23). Nazareth was a small city in Galilee. Nazareth lay on a southeastern slope of a valley. On three sides of the small city were mountains at least 500 feet above the valley. South of Nazareth was the great plain of Esdraelon, with the Sea of Galilee to the east. In the valley, there were gardens full of flowers and trees. Just outside the city, cypress trees surrounded the homes of the village people. The Nazarene scene was beautiful through all four seasons."

Just as there is no reason to put off baptism after you have fully realized your sins and the need for Jesus Christ to save you with His cleansing blood, there should be no reason to put off footwashing. Like baptism, footwashing is a sacrament empowered with Godâs grace. By following the Lordâs command, we share in His grace. As Jesus said, âIf you know these things, blessed are you if you do themâ (Jn 13:17). By receiving footwashing, we furthermore commit ourselves to following His footsteps, and participating in His divine nature. We accept the invitation to have a part in Him, and in His heavenly kingdom."
1,190,Who is the head of the church?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1405-pub.html,"Who is the head of the church? Jesus Christ is the âhead of the church.â Out of His love for the church, He gave His own life for her. So the church must submit to Christ in everything. She must follow Christâs command and do only what Christ would do, and speak what Christ would speak (Eph 5:23-24)."
1,191,In whose name should we pray?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1406-pub.html,"In whose name should we pray? At the beginning and end of each prayer we should say âIn the name of the Lord Jesus I prayâ (cf. Jn 14:13â14), for Jesusâ name was given by God (Jn 17:11â12). Jesus is Godâs name. Other ânamesâ were actually more like titles than names (e.g., memorial names like âI AM WHO I AMâ). Isaiah describes Jesus as, âWonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peaceâ (Isa 9:6). Jesus said, â[W]hatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to youâ (Jn 15:16). We should pray in Jesusâ name, for it is our salvation (Acts 4:12)."
1,192,What are the two dimensions of salvation?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1407-pub.html,"What are the two dimensions of salvation? The two dimensions of salvation are: Salvation from and forgiveness of our sins (Mt 1:21; Lk 1:77; Jn 1:29; Acts 5:31). Salvation helps us resolve the problem of sinâa problem we cannot resolve by ourselves. This is exactly why we need to be saved. If we could resolve the problem of our sins ourselves we wouldnât need saving! The Bible says, âIn him [Jesus] we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the riches of his graceâ (Eph 1:7). To those blessed by God, God does not impute their sins (Rom 4:8); instead, God credits the blessed with righteousness apart from any works (Rom 4:6). God justifies us freely, he does not justify us to repay us for something we did for him (Rom 4:4). God doesnât need anything, nor could we give him anything, for all things are his. The gift of abundant and, ultimately, eternal life (Jn 3:16; Jn 5:40; Jn 10:10, 28). Salvation resolves the result of sinâdeath. Human beings, left alone in sin, will ultimately die, both physically and spiritually. But whoever believes in the Son (Jesus Christ) has eternal life (Jn 3:36). For Jesusâ believers have crossed over from death to life (Jn 5:24). Grace reigns through righteousness to bring life through Jesus Christ our Lord (Rom 5:21). So salvation ultimately gives us eternal life."
1,193,Should spiritual tongues be intelligible?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1408-pub.html,"Should spiritual tongues be intelligible? The disciples did not actually speak in foreign languages. But God opened the ears of the Jews so that they heard the disciples speaking in their own languages (Acts 2:8,11). Ordinarily if several people speak in more than two languages at once, no one else can make out what is being said. On the day of Pentecost, however, 120 people all spoke in tongues. Jews from about 15 language groups were able to understand that they were âspeaking the wonderful works of Godâ in their own tongues (Acts 2:8-11). The tongues were not intelligible to everyone in the crowd. While the devout Jews understood the tongues, others thought the disciples had too much wine (Acts 2:13). If the disciples were indeed speaking foreign languages, why then did only the devout Jews understand what was being said? And why did the ungodly think the disciples were drunk? God intended to save the devout Jews and so allowed them to understand the tongues. Consequently, many believed and were baptized into Christ (Acts 2:37-41). The mockers, on the other hand, could not understand."
1,194,"Didn't Jesus clearly instruct His disciples to baptize ""in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"" in Matthew 28:19?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1409-pub.html,"Didn't Jesus clearly instruct His disciples to baptize ""in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"" in Matthew 28:19? We know that the Lord's words in Matthew 28 were not a formula to be recited, since the disciples always baptized and instructed people to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5). &amp;quot;In the name of&amp;quot; is not just a recitation, but indicates the authority and power of the risen Christ (Phil 2:10-11). It is in Jesus that we can have the forgiveness of sins during baptism (Col 1:14). Because it is into Christ that we are baptized (Gal 3:27), the baptismal candidate must believe the Lord Jesus is his Lord and Savior and determine to live for Christ all his life. Instead of saying &amp;quot;in Jesus' name,&amp;quot; Jesus said &amp;quot;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&amp;quot; to show that all authority that belonged to God had been given to Him. &amp;quot;Father,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Son,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the Holy Spirit&amp;quot; are not names. They are titles. The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is &amp;quot;Jesus&amp;quot; (Jn 5:43; 17:11; 14:26), and there is only one name (singular). There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved than the the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 4:10, 12). Only by the name of Jesus is a person cleansed of sin during baptism (Acts 2:38; 10:43)."

In the ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman world, the washing of feet was often the lowest form of servitude, a task delegated to slaves. But Jesus, the glorious king of heaven, knelt down and washed the feet of sinners. Most amazing of all, he even washed the feet of Judas, His betrayer. Just as the Master bowed down to serve, we as His disciples must bow down to serve othersâeven our enemies."

The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is âJesusâ (Jn 5:43; 17:11; 14:26), and there is only one name (singular). The name âJesusâ carries authority and honor (Phil 2:9-11). In the name of the Lord Jesus, baptism has the power to heal and make new. God has also manifested His power when believers cast out demons in the name of the Lord Jesus. But it is not merely the recitation of the name that makes baptism effective or drives away evil spirits. It is the presence of the Holy Spirit and the promise of God that manifests Godâs power in Jesusâ name. The name of Jesus Christ is the only one under heaven given to men by which we must be saved (Acts 4:10,12). The disciples always baptized or instructed the people to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5). In Acts 19:4-5, the believers were re-baptized âin the name of the Lord Jesus.â Only through the name of Jesus is a personâs sin cleansed during baptism (Acts 2:38; 10:43)."

Each church has its unique gift (i.e. emphasis on certain teachings). Joined together, donât they make up the body of Christ described in Ephesians 4:16? There is no biblical support to show that different churches are members of the body of Christ. Rather the believers are members of Christâs body (Eph 4:12) and the body is the church (singular; Eph 1:22-23: 5:23; Col 1:24). The church holds only one faith (Eph 4:5). Today different churches proclaim different or even conflicting beliefs about salvation. They cannot be of the same body. The church believes in one baptism (Eph 4:5). Many churches, however, disagree on the importance, efficacy, and mode of baptism. So they cannot be of the same body. The church receives only one Spirit (the Holy Spirit; Eph 4:4; 1Cor 12:13). Many churches do not even believe that believers need to pray for the Holy Spirit, with speaking in tongues as the evidence. How can they be of the same body with the true church, where believers pray for and receive the promised Holy Spirit? For the church to unite and become one, members of different denominations must remove their differences in faith, become one under the name of Jesus (Jn 17:11), and unite in the Holy Spirit (Eph 4:3-4; 1Cor 12:13) and in truth (i.e. common faith; Eph 4:5)."

Some people think the Holy Spirit is like Godâs breath. While it is true that the words spirit and breath are alike in the Hebrew language, thinking of the Spirit in terms of Godâs breath doesnât reveal Godâs full divine character. Breath just seems so inanimate and impersonal compared to a living character. The Bible shows the Holy Spirit has divine character. The Spirit searches all things (1 Cor 2:10); he has his own will (Rom 8:27; 1 Cor 12:11); he is loving (Rom 15:30); he gives grace (Heb 10:20); he can be grieved (Eph 4:30); he instructs (Neh 9:20); he can speak (Acts 8:29); he prevents (Acts 16:6â7); he commands (Acts 13:2, 4; Isa 48:16); he establishes ministry (Acts 20:28); he testifies (1 Jn 5:7); and he reveals (Eph 3:5). All these actions show the Holy Spirit has divine character."
1,199,What types of sin are there?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1414-pub.html,"What types of sin are there? To sin is to miss the mark. When we fall short of Godâs intention for us, then we sin. God has set out His intentions clearly in the Bible; His fundamental requirements are the Ten Commandments. And the essence of those 10 commandments can be distilled to these two: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and mind. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (Mt 22:37-49) When we fail to do so, then we sin. The Bible tells us we must put to death these sins: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, covetousness, anger, malice, blasphemy, filthy language, lying (Col 3:5-9; see also 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-7). Following the desires of our flesh will lead us to these sins. Failure to do the good we know we should do is also sin (Jas 4:17; known as âsin of omissionâ). The good we know we should do is also derived from the two essential commandments. We need to be holy, faithful, merciful, kind, patient; meek and humble; forbearing and forgiving; loving to the point of sacrifice."

John carefully recorded not only the act that Jesus performed, but the instructions and spiritual teachings that He imparted to the disciples during the sacrament of footwashing. All of the Lordâs commandments need to be kept. Not a single commandment can be neglected, regardless of how many times it is mentioned in the Bible (Mt 5:18-19; Rev 22:19). We can thus be sure that although there is no biblical record of the disciples performing the sacrament, they would have obeyed Jesusâ direct instruction to them."
1,201,Isn't keeping the Sabbath a Jewish tradition?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1416-pub.html,"Isnât keeping the Sabbath a Jewish tradition? The Sabbath was instituted in the very beginning (Gen 2:1-3; Ex 20:11), before the nation of Israel existed. There was no death, no religion, no covenant, no law, no nation, no Jew or Gentile and, of course, no racial distinction. Jesus said the âSabbath was made for manâ (Mk 2:27)ânot only for the Jews. The benefits and privileges of receiving rest, blessings, and sanctification from observing the seventh-day Sabbath are given to all mankind. Honoring the Sabbath day is the fourth of the Ten Commandments. Even though they were first entrusted to the chosen people of the Old Testament, Godâs commands are passed on to the chosen people of the New Testament (see Acts 7:38). The Ten Commandments have never been abolished; they still need to be kept by Christians today (Lk 18:18-20; 1 Cor 7:19; 1 Jn 5:2-3; Rev 14:12). Isaiahâs prophecy that foreigners will keep the Sabbath further confirms that Gentile believers in the New Testament will keep Godâs Sabbath (Isa 56:6-7). So Sabbath observance isnât just limited to the Israelite nation."

Baptism is not simply a public expression of salvation. The Bible makes it clear that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 22:16; 2:38). We receive Godâs salvation through baptism (1 Pet 3:20-21; Col 2:11-12; Rom 6:3-4; Gal 3:26-27).
1,203,Why does God allow people to sin?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1418-pub.html,"Why does God allow people to sin? God did not create a world of robots to mechanically serve His purposes. He created the universe to manifest His divine nature of love. But true love can only exist with freedom, just as true righteousness can only exist with freedom. We cannot truly love if we are forced to do so against our will; we cannot be morally perfect if we do not choose to do good out of our own volition. To protect the well being of His creation, God established laws for us to obey. God shows us what is good: âto do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humblyâ with Him (Mic 6:8). His commandments also teach us the consequences of our choices (Rom 5:13). But He permits us the freedom to do as we will. He wants human beings to love Him and obey His commands out of our own volition, not out of compulsion."

Aren't sacraments of works, not of faith? &amp;quot;Works&amp;quot; in this passage refer to the works of the law (Gal 2:16; 3:2; Rom 9:32). Works of the law do not come from faith but from a desire to obtain righteousness without the saving works of Jesus Christ. It would be a mistake to say that anything involving physical action is a &amp;quot;work.&amp;quot; If that is the case, then confession with our mouths would be a &amp;quot;work.&amp;quot; The Lord Jesus Himself commanded the sacraments. Denying the Lord's commands is not faith at all. In receiving the sacraments, it is not the physical action on the part of the believer that saves. It is the mercy of God and the saving work of Christ that brings us the effect. Faith is not just intellectual agreement. Faith without action is not true faith. Such false faith cannot save (Jas 2:14; Mt 7:21-23)."

Baptism in the Bible was performed in natural water (see Hastings, âBAPTISM.â Dictionary of the Bible [New York: Charles Scribnerâs Sons, 1963]). John the Baptist baptized the Lord Jesus in the Jordan River (Jn 3:13). John the Baptist also baptized at Aenon (Jn 3:23); the word âAenonâ means âspring.â There is no Scriptural basis for baptism in pools. Zechariah prophesied that a fountain would be opened to cleanse sins (Zech 13:1). The flood in Noahâs time as well as the crossing of the Red Sea prefigured baptism (1 Pet 3:20; 1Cor 10:1-2). The prophet Micah also prophesied that God would âcast all our sins into the depths of the seaâ (Mic 7:19). In all cases, natural water, and never manmade pools or cisterns, represents baptism. Lastly, the early church performed baptism in living water (see Everett Furgenson, Early Christians Speak [Austin: Sweet Publishing Company, 1971], 51)."
1,209,Some churches believe in the baptism of the dead. Is this correct?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1424-pub.html,"Some churches believe in the baptism of the dead. Is this correct? People who believe in baptizing the dead cite 1 Corinthians 15:29, where Paul asks, âOtherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?â Yet this passage does not command baptism for the dead nor make any judgment about such practice. Paulâs point was not that such practice was correct, but that the practice demonstrated peopleâs belief in the resurrection. Paul could not have endorsed vicarious baptism (baptizing the living on behalf of the dead) because it is against biblical teaching: Baptism is for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 22:16). Since all have sinned (Rom 3:23), everyone must be baptized for the forgiveness of his own sins (Acts 2:38). No one may be baptized for the forgiveness of anotherâs sins. Baptism is not merely a formality or an immersion of the body; it is a spiritual cleansing and salvation of the soul (1 Pet 3:21; Heb 9:14). Once a person dies, the soul leaves his body. Baptizing a living person on behalf of the dead cannot in any way save the soul of the dead. After a person dies, he faces judgment (Heb 9:27). Those who failed to believe in the Lord will be condemned (Mk 16:16; Rev 21:8), and every person will be judged according to his deeds (Rev 20:12). Once a person dies, he has to give an account of his disbelief and no one else may receive salvation on his behalf."

By the time Jesus was born, the Jewish nation had been conquered by the Romans. But the Roman government adopted a tolerant policy toward the Jews, allowing them to practice their religion. The Jews, in return, would offer daily sacrifices in the temple on behalf of the Roman Emperor. The Romans allowed autonomous rule in certain areas of Palestine, which were areas where traditional Jewish customs could be maintained. However, Rome would always retain the power to station armies to keep Roman order. Moreover, the Jews would have to pay taxes to the Roman emperor (Lk 20:25). So autonomous rule is questionable during Jesusâ time. The Jewish nation was protected by the Roman empire, but it was also subjected to it. In 37 B.C., the âHerodian courtâ was founded along with the Jewish council. Although the Jews had the power to handle religious issues and gather opinions, death sentences had to be given by Roman officials to legally execute (Mt 27:1â2). Therefore, the Jewish nation was more in name than in power."

On what basis was this   decision made?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1426-pub.html,"Who decided which books to include in the Bible? On what basis was this decision made? One thing to keep in mind is that the church did not create the canon , or books included in what we call Scripture. The church recognized the books that were inspired by God when written. [ T he word canon comes from the root word âreedâ (English word, âcaneâ; Hebrew form ganeh and Greek Kanon). The reed was used as a measuring rod and eventually meant âstandard.â As applied to Scripture, canon means âan officially accepted list of books.â] There were approximately five guiding principles used to determine whether or not a New Testament book is canonical (Norman L. Geisler and William E. Nix, A General Introduction to the Bible [Chicago: Moody Press, 1968], 141): Is it authoritative? Did it come from the hand of God? Does this book come with a divine âthus says the Lord?â Does it agree with earlier revelation? It is prophetic? Was it written by a man of God? Is it authentic? The church fathers had the policy, âif in doubt, throw it out.â Is it dynamic? Did it come with the life-transforming power of love? Was it received, collected, read and used? Was it acceptable to the people of God?"

If a person has to be a member of the only true church to be saved, then will these Christians not be saved?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1427-pub.html,"There are countless Christians in various denomination all over the world who truly love the Lord and are very fervent. If a person has to be a member of the only true church to be saved, then will these Christians not be saved? Christians of other denominations who have heard the true and complete gospel proclaimed by the church and yet refuse to accept it cannot be called true Christians; for they do not follow the will of the Heavenly Father, even though they might be working fervently in Jesusâ name (see Mt 7:21-23). They will have to take full responsibility for their rejection of the true gospel (Heb 2:1-4). Indeed there are many others who humbly search for the truth and love the Lord with great fervor but have never heard the complete gospel of salvation. These people are the âother sheep I have which are not of this foldâ and the Lord Jesus will bring them so that all true believers would be one flock (Jn 10:16). It is the Lordâs will that all believers become one for the glory of the Heavenly Father (Jn 17:11, 20-23). âNow it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the LORDâS house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to itâ (Isa 2:2-4; Mic 4:1-3; see also Hag 2:6-9). This prophecy points to the glory of the true church in the future and that all true believers will join the true church. As for those Christians who never had a chance to find the true church in their lifetime, it is not up to us to judge if they would be saved. The Lord God will be the ultimate judge. But most importantly, we need to accept the complete gospel and the true church once we have found it."
1,213,Isn't belief in Jesus enough?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1428-pub.html,"Isnât belief in Jesus enough? Believing in Christ is not just intellectually agreeing that He is Lord and Savior. True faith involves obeying His words (Lk 6:46-49). We are saved by grace through faith, but faith without deeds is not true faith (Jas 2:14-20). Even evil spirits believe that Jesus is the Son of God (Mt 8:28-29; Lk 4:41), but their belief is not true faith (Jas 2:19-20). We cannot dismiss the necessity of baptism since baptism itself is an act of belief and faith in Jesus Christ (Mk 16:16; see Acts 16:30-33)."
1,214,Are there biblical examples of prayer?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1429-pub.html,"Are there biblical examples of prayer? Yes. There are too many examples of prayer to list. But hereâs a short sampling of people in the Bible who prayed: Abraham prayed for Godâs mercy on Sodom, a city destined to be destroyed by God (Gen 18:23). However, God still destroyed the city of Sodom because there were not ten righteous people found in the city (Gen 18:32; Gen 19:12ff). However, God did consider Abrahamâs request for his nephew Lot, who lived in Sodom. Jacob prayed that he might escape his brother Esauâs anger (Gen 32:9). Moses prayed for the Israelites that they might escape Godâs wrath (Ex 32:11, 14). Hezekiah prayed to God for healing (2 Kgs 20:2). David prayed for his son Solomon that Solomon would have a loyal heart toward God and build Godâs temple (1 Chr 29:19). Elijah prayed for rain to relieve a long drought (Jas 5:18). Jesus prayed, on the cross, for the forgiveness of those who crucified him. Jesus prayed for their forgiveness since he knew they did it in ignorance (Lk 23:34). Waiting upon the Lordâs promise, the disciples prayed for the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem (Acts 1:14)."
1,215,What year was Jesus born?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1430-pub.html,"What year was Jesus born? According to the accepted consensus of historians, Jesus was born around 750 years after the traditional date for the founding of the Roman empire in 753 B.C. Our era is dated according to a Christian perspective, which begins from the year of our Lord (in Latin anno Domini). Christâs supposed birth was A.D. 1, but due to a mistake in calculation by a Scythian monk from Rome, Christ was actually born around 4 B.C., or possibly earlier. The date of Christâs birth is calculated according to {Matthew 2:1) and {Luke 1:5), which tells us Jesus was born when Herod the Great was still alive. Herod died in 4 B.C., which means Jesus was born in 4 B.C. or earlier."

Jesus preached for about three years. He was betrayed by his disciple Judas Iscariot and crucified by those who did not believe he was the Messiah. Jesus became the price of our salvation. He was flogged and mocked before crucifixion. Wearing a purple robe and a crown of thorns, a mocking image of a king, soldiers spat on Jesus while they beat him. Jesus suffered so harshly because he willingly submitted himself to the punishment. Jesus had the power to resist, for he had authority over angels (Mt 26:53). To human eyes, with only a surface understanding, Jesus lost dearly. But how wrong to think Jesus lost, when he actually won the hardest battle we faceâthe battle against sin and death itself (1 Cor 15:53â57; Col 2:15)."

1,218,Why do we have to repent before we can receive salvation?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1433-pub.html,"Why do we have to repent before we can receive salvation? We repent because we fear God. âSurely his [Godâs] salvation is at hand for those who fear Himâ (Ps 85:9). One of the criminals who was crucified near Jesus came under the fear of judgment and repented before the Lord. The result? The criminal received Jesusâ saving grace (Lk 23:39â43). Unfortunately, those who do not fear God will be hard pressed to receive Godâs grace. We repent because we are humbled before God. âGod resists the proud, but gives grace to the humbleâ (1 Pet 5:5). A tax collector, often viewed as extortionists in Jesusâ time, humbled himself before God and said, âGod, be merciful to me a sinner!â Because of the tax collectorâs humility in recognizing his own sin, he was fully justified by the Lord (Lk 18:13â14). âFor, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they [the Israelites] did not submit to Godâs righteousnessâ (Rom 10:3). Because of the pride and status many Israelites held in the law, they were unable to see Jesus was the end of the law for righteousness (Rom 10:4). From the Israelitesâ mistake we see how pride is the greatest obstacle among those who could have received Godâs salvation had they been humble enough to accept it."

1,220,Doesn't everyone just interpret the Bible differently?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1435-pub.html,"Doesnât everyone just interpret the Bible differently? Although there are many interpretations, when it comes to the truth of salvation, there can be only one true gospel (Gal 1:6-9; Eph 4:4-6). For example, we either need to be baptized to be saved or we do not need baptism. Both cannot be true. We must study and find the true gospel that is according to the Bible. The truth of the gospel does not come from academic research but from the direct revelation of God through His Spirit (1 Cor 3:9-13; Gal 1:11-12). In the True Jesus Church, the gospel of salvation was revealed to the first believers by the Holy Spirit. We who have received the promised Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, today also are able to understand and accept the true gospel (Jn 16:13). The interpretation that God confirms is the correct interpretation. Just as God sent fire from heaven to confirm the preaching of Elijah, God also confirms the truth of the gospel with the gifts of the Holy Spirit and miraculous signs (Heb 2:3-4; Mk 16:20; 1 Cor 2:4). Believers in the true church experience God directly when they receive the Holy Spirit; people witness blood in baptism, which demonstrates the power of baptism to forgive sins; many receive healing and miracles when they seek and obey the gospel. All these wondrous deeds of God show that the truth the church preaches is from God."
1,229,Whose Side Are You On?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1446-pub.html,"Whose Side Are You On? Joshua 5 tells of Joshua's encounter with a man before taking the city of Jericho. God had told Joshua that He would give the Israelites the land of Canaan if they obeyed the law and were strong and courageous (Josh 1:6-7). Being close to enemy territory, Joshua asked the man a valid question: âAre You for us or for our adversaries?â (Josh 5:13). The manâs reply, however, was surprising: âNo, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now comeâ (Josh 5:14). Knowing the situation, one would expect the man to say he was for the Israelites, since God had promised them the land. But He said that He was not for either side. This shows that God is just. He does not show favoritism. As humans, we are all equal in the eyes of God. The manâs response also reminded Joshua that he was fighting the battle against the Canaanites not for himself, but for God. By the end of his career, it was clear to Joshua that the battle and the victory belonged to God. Thus, he was able to say, âas for me and my household, we will serve the Lordâ (Josh 24:15). Because we, as Christians, are living for Christ, we should remember that our âbattlesâ in life are not for ourselves, but for God. With this in mind, we will be able to work fairly and with integrity. In our daily lives, we may need to make difficult decisions and come across conflict. Of course, we should pray for Godâs help and guidance. But we also need to consider our own attitude when praying to God. We should not ask God whether He is on our side; rather, we should ask ourselves whether we are on Godâs side. As long as we obey Godâs commandments, He will be with us wherever we go (Josh 1:7-9). Joshua was submissive when he realized to whom he was speaking. He fell on his face and worshiped. Let us also humble ourselves and submit to God, instead of asking Him to do what we want."
1,238,Why Complain?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1455-pub.html,"Why Complain? As children grow, parents can see how they slowly change. When they are very young they are obedient and willing to do any job they are asked to do, even little things like getting a book or throwing something away. But as they grow up, they often start to question the authority of their parents. At times there is a lot of moaning and groaning before a child will do what his or her parents say. Sometimes we, too, do things reluctantly and voice our complaints. We tend to question things and not do things with a willing heart. Whatever happens to us we grumble, just like the Israelites who murmured in the wilderness because they didnât have any food (Ex 16:1-3). Grumbling and irritability prevents us from shining our lights as true Christians. One of the many virtues we must gain is to do things without complaining. If you have this sort of attitude, people can see your good character and follow your actions. It also sets a good example for the younger ones. One of the main reasons we shouldnât complain is because it disrupts the unity of the church. If there are a lot of disputes and arguments in the church, how can the church accomplish work or grow in harmony? If students at school, for example, quarrel with the teacher or with each other, how can they learn and grow in knowledge? Today, letâs help one another without complaining. Let us not murmur or blame God because of the difficult things that have happened to us. We should thank the Lord all the more for the grace and blessings He bestows upon us daily. Let us preach His precious Word for all to hear."
1,250,What Makes a Winner?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1467-pub.html,"What Makes a Winner? Audiences watch in admiration when top athletes display their skill and determination in pursuit of their goal. We are more than mere bystanders, however; the contest of sport serves as a metaphor for the course of life. ""Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown,"" writes the apostle Paul (1 Cor 9:25). So what lessons can we learn on becoming a victorious Christian? 1) Follow the guidelines ""If anyone competes in athletics,"" Paul reminded the successor of his baton, ""he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules"" (2 Tim 2:5). A clause was added to the Olympic oath against dopingâand when athletes failed to live up to their oath, they lost their gold medals. The Bible tells us, ""Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city"" (Rev 22:14). Keeping the Lord's commands is not discounting His grace, nor is it being legalistic. Just as the athlete who adheres to the rules without complaint glorifies the game, the faithful who abide by the commandments glorify the Creator. Jesus Christ said, ""If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love"" (Jn 15:10). 2) Keep the goal in focus We need to be clear about the goal, or we may stray from the course, falter, or fall away: it is to enter the kingdom of heaven and receive, as Paul reminds us, the ""imperishable crown."" We don't follow Jesus out of the expectation that things will always go our way, that our lives will be successful and trouble-free. If the Lord grants us material blessings, healing, or peace, it is out of His mercy and grace. ""But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you"" (Lk 12:31). 3) Run with conviction When an underdog was asked whether she expected to win, her reply was a firm ""Yes."" To be a winner, you need to run with full conviction in the prize ahead. Every step must be a firmly placed move closer to the finish line. ""I run thus: not with uncertainty,"" says Paul, ""Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air"" (1 Cor 9:26). 4) Discipline yourself ""I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lestâ¦I myself should become disqualified"" (1 Cor 9:27). Athletes have to withstand a lot of pain and drain in order to win. We've seen some who compete even while injured. Their will to win compels them on to surpass their physical limitations. As spiritual athletes, we are in a constant struggle against the weaknesses of our flesh: worries, desires, pride, sin. Sometimes it's painful, but we need to press on, overlooking the momentary burn, toward the lasting gains. Discipline also means constant watchfulness, for even when we feel strong, we need to be careful. Studies have shown that athletes are more susceptible to viral infections right after competition because their immune systems are weakened after the strain. Even if we are at the peak of our conditioning, fighting spiritual battles can leave us vulnerable. ""Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall"" (1 Cor 10:12). Yet we are not on our own. God is our Helper, and willing to fight for us. But we have to have the will to follow His way first. We have to learn the rules and stick to them, and run with full conviction towards the goal."
1,325,Which Kind of Builder Are You?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1542-pub.html,"Which Kind of Builder Are You? Once upon a time, as the story goes, there were three little pigs. When they were grown, their mother sent them off to make their own living and advised them to build their homes with bricks and mortar. The first pig, however, was so interested in his own pursuits, that he quickly built a straw house. The second pig remembered his motherâs advice but, unable to give up other enjoyments completely, he compromised and built his house of sticks. The third pig heeded his motherâs advice and carefully built a brick house with mortar. A big bad wolf came and toppled the straw house with one blow and devoured the first pig. After a few blows from different directions, the second house and its owner met their demise, too. But the last house, carefully constructed of bricks and mortar, stood firmly in its place, and the third pig was saved. Jesus also told a story about wise and foolish builders. After delivering His sermon on the Mount of Olives (Mt 5:3-7:23), the Lord told the crowds that âwhoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does themâ will be like a wise man who built his house on a rock, but whoever hears and does not do them âwill be like a foolish man who built his house on the sandâ (Mt 7:24-27). He wanted us to compare building our faith to building a house. We know the purpose of a house is to protect its inhabitants from wind, rain, and other elements. One built on rock will have a stable foundation, but the one built on sand will fall in the face of the storm. Likewise, in our faith we will encounter troubles and challenges. How we have built our faith will determine whether or not we can remain standing after all. From both stories, we see that there are several possible approaches to building. There are some who hear the teachings in church and believe they are good. Yet they pay little attention to practicing what they have heard. There are things of greater interest to them, and they have little time to spare. They walk away with no intention of changing their lives. After a day or two, they have forgotten the sermon altogether. When someone gossips or is inconsiderate, they are offended and, forgetting the Bibleâs teaching about forgiveness, leave the church. The second kind of believer hears the message and knows the importance of faith. Though they attempt to apply the teachings to their life, they still love the world. When someone offends them, they know the need to forgive, but still hold small grudges. They lack the time to cultivate themselves spiritually. Eventually, in the face of temptation, they cannot bear it and give up their faith. We must build our homes on the rock by not only hearing, but also practicing the teachings we have heard. To do so requires constant meditation upon them, aided by taking notes during sermons, or listening to sermon tapes. As we absorb the teachings, we will learn to apply them in every aspect of our lives. And once we practice them often, they will become like a reflex. When troubles come, we are able to deal with them correctly and naturally. For every problem, we have a biblical solution. With this firm foundation, we can enter safely into the heavenly kingdom."
1,345,Will You Trust in Egypt's Shadow?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1562-pub.html,"Will You Trust in Egyptâs Shadow? King Hezekiah of Judah sent his ambassadors to Egypt with the intention of forming an alliance to defeat the powerful Assyrians. Although Hezekiah feared the Lord and had experienced much grace from God, he ignored the Lordâs guidance and turned first to Pharaoh when he saw the strength of the Assyrians. The actions of King Hezekiah represent the tendency of humans to rely on the physical things of this world rather than on God. With the advancement of science and technology, we easily begin ""trusting in the shadow of Egypt."" We rely on our own wisdom and walk by sight instead of by faith. For example, when we are ill, we often choose to place all our faith in modern medicine, seeking the best doctors, rather than placing our trust in God. We need to learn to have faith that the one and only true God will do what is best for us. We need to remember that the physical things of this world are only temporary; only God is immortal, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. It is important that we do not ignore the guidance of God and do things according to our own wisdom, like King Hezekiah, even when Godâs guidance is not what we wish to hear. Let us learn the instruction of Proverbs 3:5-8: Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from evil. It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones."
1,349,What Kind of People Ought You to Be?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1566-pub.html,"What Kind of People Ought You to Be? As Christians, though we have been enlightened by the gospel of truth, we still experience great difficulty in our attempt to live a life that is completely untainted by secular ways. One powerful force that holds us back is the constant influence of the majority. Secular friends and relatives surround us with worldly trends that are unhealthy for our spiritual life. But we often give way to weakness and entertain thoughts that desire what they have or what they can do. We follow the crowd, blindly pursuing with all our mind and strength the things of this material world, as though they would last forever. We forget that one day the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. God chose us, as He had the Israelites, so that we may be a people different and set apart from the rest. God wants us to live a holy and godly life that will bring glory to His name. It is an undisputed fact, however, that everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ will be persecuted (2 Tim 3:12). Faced with so many temptations and obstacles, it is indeed a narrow and difficult path that we have chosen. Yet one simple but essential factor will continue to spur us on: faith. Faith in the word of God and conviction of His promises allows us to foresee the future. Faith transcends the immediate but passing glories of the present. By faith we believe Jesus will come again. By faith we believe that this world and everything in it will be destroyed by fire. Therefore our ultimate hope is not in this world, but in a new heaven and a new earth. With this hope as our constant motivation we can forget what is behind and strain toward what is ahead. Even though this road is narrow, in the end it leads to life. Thus ""we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal""(2 Cor 4:18). The majority of the Israelites failed to lead a consecrated life. They conformed to the ways of the Gentiles around them. Today, taking this warning from history to heart, let us learn to recognize and cherish our precious status before God, stand firm, and surmount the battery of sinful tides. Many a time when it seemed we stood alone, we in fact were not. For a great cloud of witnesses surrounds us. So ""let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us"" (Heb 12:1)."
1,351,Is the Lord Among Us or Not?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1568-pub.html,"Is the Lord Among Us or Not? The Israelites were a people who were enslaved with great burdens and oppressed on a daily basis. They had no hope until God through Moses delivered them from the hand of Pharaoh. Yet this greatest blessing they had received now seemed distant. They were now faced with thirst again. The first time they faced this situation, they had water that had been bitter and was made sweet (Ex 15:22-27). But now they did not even have bitter water at hand to quench their thirst. Have you ever experienced a hot summerâs day when you've walked around town for the day or had a game of football under the sun, and you feel really thirsty afterward? That was how everyone felt at that time. No wonder they wanted to stone Moses (Ex 17:4). When you feel that your body needs something, you want to gratify that desire as soon as possible. If you are hungry and you do not get food into your stomach, you start to become irritable. And that was how the Israelites felt. The problem was they went so far as to tempt the Lord by asking, ""Is the Lord among us or not?"" (Ex 17:7). They completely upset the will of the Lord. They said to Moses, ""Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"" (Ex 17:3). Thus they complained to God indirectly. They knew it was God who brought them out of the land of Egypt and not Moses. In their hearts, they were dissatisfied with God. Their physical suffering changed their view on who God was. When things went their way, they followed quietly and obediently. When things did not go their way for a moment, they turned their hearts against God. The price God's people had to pay for following Him out of Egypt was the comforts of life. They did not get things when they wanted it. They had to learn to trust in God. The Israelites could not deduce what kind of God had delivered them from the Egyptians. He who delivered them with such a mighty hand could and would give them their daily necessities. This God was the God of their forefather, Abraham. He was Jehovah-Jireh, ""The Lord will provide"" (Gen 22:14). Otherwise, how could God bring them out of oppression into the Promised Land (Ex 3:8)?"
1,402,What Do You See?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1619-pub.html,"What Do You See? I like looking at people. There are all kinds of good places to do thisâat the airport, on a train, from a shop window... Sometimes Iâll look at a young child and think, what will this boy look like when heâs an old man? I can almost see that ancient face amid childhoodâs bloom. Other times, I look at the old. Their faces are often so tired and sad. But if I look closelyâin their eyes, the curves and planes of their bonesâI can sometimes see the faces of kings and queens. Or again, walking through a sea of faces on a city street, I have the overpowering feeling that I am about to see someone I know, even though I may be ten thousand miles from home. So what am I supposed to glean from these imaginings, these premonitions, these almost-visions? Are these remnants of an Edenic familiarity that I am called to act upon? Nowadays such occasions are rare. Mostly, I simply see what I want to see in other people. Itâs too tiring to try to see more. The labels, categories, and boxes that we put people in, if rarely true, are at least useful in one respect: to insulate us from each other and to make the world more manageable. But this insulation is not always a good thing. As I get older, I feel that I am growing gradually harder and tougher inside. I have learned to fashion impassable barricades with the raw materials of past experience, prejudice, and fear. The Bible, as it so often does, teaches differently. From reading the Word of God, it seems that we were meant to follow a reversed developmental process in one important respect: that we become ever more open, ever more innocent of the evil of hardened hearts. âThough our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day,"" Paul says (2Cor 4:16). We must become like little children to enter the kingdom of God (Mt 18:3). Letâs also look at the case of Peter (Acts 10). Here was a man who thought that the gospel would never move outside of the Jewish circles he knew. But miraculously, with the urging (nay, prodding) of God, Peter finally took the plunge and traveled to Caesarea to preach Jesus Christ to a Gentile, to someone whom he could previously envision only as something akin to a reptile, a cloven-hoofed animal, or any number of other bestiary symbols of ritual uncleanness. But when Peter got to Caesarea, a most wonderful thing happened. God's Spirit, the same Spirit that moved within Peter, descended upon Cornelius. In wonder, Peter exclaimed, ""Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"" On that day Peterâs life changed, for it was on that day that he met his brother in Cornelius. In the eighties film Wings of Desire , angels are sent down to earth to watch over the planet's sad inhabitants. These invisible messengers hear the silent stories of humans, comforting and holding them in invisible arms as they cry. We may wonder: Is it only angels who can possess this kind of vision? What would I have to do to see the person in front of me truly, not as a construct of demography but as a child of God? No, we do not have to be angels. For the story of Peter gives us a very clear message. If we are prayerful, if we are attentive to the cues, large and small, that the Lord gives us, we too can change the way we look into the faces of those around us. Lord, fill us with your love. Give us new eyes to see with. Help us to see your children, our brothers and sisters, all around us."
1,425,Whose Money Is It?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1642-pub.html,"Whose Money Is It? You came into the world with nothing, and you aren't going to take anything with you when you go. What makes you think that the assets that you get in the time between the snipping of your umbilical cord and the closing of your casket belong to you? The Bible has an interesting perspective on finances. It says that everything belongs to God. The earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness; the world and those who dwell therein."" (Ps 24:1) Both riches and honor come from You, and You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; In Your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all... But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from You, and of Your own we have given You."" (1 Chr 29:12,14) However, the government certainly doesn't adhere to this position. It requires income taxes from you because your name is on the paycheck. So where do you fit into the ""God owns everything"" scenario? That can be answered with one word: oikonomos. Although this sounds more like the name of a prescription ointment for athlete's foot fungus, it is a Greek word that translates into English as ""stewardship."" The term implies a manager of a household who administers someone else's property. God has made us the stewards of His possessions: ""You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet"" (Ps 8:6). If what we have belongs to God, then we should manage it according to His principles. This perspective means that every decision we make about our moneyâfrom how to spend it to how to invest itâhas spiritual ramifications. We are not just accountable to God for the few bucks we might toss into the offering box at church, and we are not off the hook with God so long as we pay Him a surcharge of a certain percentage of our earnings. If God owns it all, then we must be faithful stewards in handling all of it. There are eight areas in which we should be faithful as financial stewards: We should work diligently. (Prov 12:24, 13:4, 20:4) We should spend wisely. (Isa 55:2) We should save consistently. (Mt 25:15-30) We should avoid debt. (Rom 13:8) We should give generously. (Prov 11:25, 22:9; 2Cor 9:5) We should deal with others honestly. (Rom 13:13; 1 Thess 4:12; Heb 13:18) We should seek wise counsel from others. (Prov 19:20; Judg 18:5; 2 Chron 10:6) We should teach our children how to manage money properly. (Mt 25:15-30; Deut 4:10) If you believe the Bible when it says that everything belongs to God, then you can believe the Bible when it says that God will take care of all of your needs. Our part is to be good stewards of what God has given to us; God's part is to make sure that we have everything that we need: Therefore do not worry, saying, ""What shall we eat?"" or ""What shall we drink?"" or ""What shall we wear?"" For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added to you. (Mt 6:31-33) If we approach our finances as belonging to God instead of ourselves, it will make us more responsible in how we handle our money, and it will change our perspectives about what is important in life. Living in Sacred Simplicity If we handle our finances as if they belong to God and if we trust Him to provide all of our needs, then we don't have to panic when the stock market drops or the price of Oreos at the supermarket rises. God is in charge, and we don't have to worry about our future: Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. (Phil 4:6-7) There is the real secret for shedding feelings of being a financial failure. When you live with a divine perspective about your finances, it simplifies your life. Instead of fretting about your money, you can enjoy a feeling of sacred simplicity. Approaching life with a view of sacred simplicity works something like this: God will supply all of your needs, so you don't have to worry about them. You can be content with what you have now, and you can be content in the future if God increases or decreases your net worth. The amount doesn't really matter because God has promised to give you everything you need. You don't need to worry about the future. There may be times of increase and decrease in your financial position. Either way, God is in charge. In both circumstances you are to trust Him. You don't rely on your cash reserves in the good times, and you don't worry about insufficiency in the tough times. The concept of sacred simplicity is foreign to our culture. It goes against the prevailing thought of becoming self-sufficient and independently wealthy with a plump retirement account. So it is natural that you might misunderstand the applicable principles of sacred simplicity. Don't get the wrong impression: Sacred simplicity is not devoted deprivation. You aren't required to give all of your money to the church or mission works. You don't have to cancel buying presents and gifts for your family and friends. Sacred simplicity is not pious parsimony. God doesn't want you to blame Him for being a cheapskate. You don't have to stiff the waitress out of a fifteen percent tip and you don't have to sneak soda and treats into the movie theater just because you are trying to be a good steward of God's money. He wants the waitress to get a generous tip, and he doesn't want you to smuggle M&amp;M's in your socks. Sacred simplicity is not ardent austerity. Good stewardship does not require selling all of your possessions and wearing a trash bag instead of clothes from the Gap. You don't have to sell your 2002 Lexus and replace it with a 1980 Pinto (if you can find a Pinto that is still running). God doesn't object to money or the things that it can buy. But He does want you to have the proper perspective. Sacred simplicity is not sanctimonious sluggishness. Don't think that you can quit your job and live on the beach because God has promised to provide everything you need. Stewardship requires you to be a diligent worker. Sacred simplicity has nothing to do with the quantity of your money. But it has everything to do with the quality of your heart. If you want to move from failure to success in your finances, then change your perspective and attitude. Realize that everything belongs to God and that you are responsible to Him as a steward for what He has given to you. Then relax and stop worrying because God has everything under control."
1,435,Just One Talent?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1652-pub.html,"Just One Talent? proÂ·crasÂ·tiÂ·nate, vbÂto defer action; to delay. Or simply said, to put off until tomorrow what can be done today. To some people, procrastination is just plain, simple laziness, but to those who have it honed to perfection, it's an art. And what an art it isÂdoing major spring cleaning the day before the in-laws arrive; preparing an hour-long presentation, complete with charts, graphs, and slides, the night before the meeting; or cranking out a fifteen-page paper eight hours before it's due, all the while wired on adrenalin or caffeine or both and berating oneself for not having begun a day earlier. But no matter how slapdash our efforts may be, we still enjoy some modicum of success from our labors. We arrogantly call it ""rising to the challenge,"" and we delude ourselves into believing that we produce better work under pressure. So with the next chore, project, or paper that comes along, we procrastinateÂagain. This is, of course, assuming that we know the deadline. What if we don't know the exact deadline? Should we postpone indefinitely whatever it is that needs to be done? ""But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking... and did not know until the flood came and took them all away"" (Mt 24:37-39). In light of this warning, procrastination is surely not the smartest course of action. Jesus himself exhorts us time and again in the Bible to ""watch therefore"" and ""also be ready"" for His second coming, because ""of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father"" (Mt 24:36-44; Mk 13:32-37; Lk 21:34-36). ""I will come upon you as a thief"" is His final warning to us in Revelation 3:3. Though these warnings resound through the Scriptures, we watch with a sense of detachment as the signs of the end of the age manifest. We reassure ourselves that the end is not quite imminent because our church is not yet ""perfect,"" and we become complacent in the knowledge that we still have ""time."" This is assuming that we live to see Jesus' second coming. Or maybe we believe that we'll live until we're seventy, and that we'll be able to compress into the last five years of our lives what we should have accomplished over five decades. What if Jesus decides to call us away tomorrow? What will we have to show for our time here on earth, for His care and guidance and grace? Are we ready to face Him come Judgment Day? Parable of the Talents There once was a man who was called away to a far country. He decided to entrust the care of his estate to his servants and gave them various amounts of money. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to a third he gave oneÂto each according to his own ability. The servant who received the five talents went and traded them and doubled his money, as did the servant with the two talents. However, the third servant dug a hole and buried his one talent in the ground. After a long time, the man returned and called his servants in to settle accounts with them. The first servant said, ""Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them."" And the lord said to him, ""Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord."" Likewise, the servant with the two talents showed the two he had gained, and the lord praised him similarly. Finally, the servant with the one talent came before the lord and said, ""Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. And I was afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours."" ""You wicked and lazy servant,"" the lord replied, ""you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed. So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest."" The lord then took away that servant's one talent and gave it to the servant who had ten, saying, ""For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth"" (Mt 25:14-30). The Talents In Biblical times, a talent was a unit of money worth about 6,000 denarii. One denarius was the equivalent of a day's wages, so it would take a common worker approximately twenty years to save one talent (and that's if the worker subsisted on air). Realistically, an individual would have to work at least twice that amount of time (a lifetime!) to be able to save that much money. How fitting it is, then, that the modern definition of talent is a special or natural ability, for only something we are born with can be so priceless. We use ""talented"" to describe someone who is naturally skilled at doing something, like drawing or singing or writing. True, those skills can be learned to a certain extent, but creative genius either is there or it isn't. It can't be bought. We can try to explain it scientifically and say that it's because a certain part of the brain is more highly developed or because it was passed down by a miraculous combination of genes, but the gist of it is that we are given talent (or talents) the moment we are conceived. Now, the operative word here is ""given."" Who ""gives"" us our talents? Our parents? If our parents could give us talents, we would all be Bill Gates. Frightening thought. No, we receive our talents from God, just as we receive every other blessing from Him. Like the lord who gave a different amount of talents to each of his servants, God, too, gives us ""gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us"" (Rom 12:6). Some of us cook, some of us clean, some teach, and some preach, ""for as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ"" (Rom 12:4-5). Even Christ's body needs knees and elbows as well as fingers and toes. God gave us different gifts not out of bias or favoritism but so that we may make His body complete. ""If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?... And if they were all one member, where would the body be?"" (1 Cor 12:17-19). God doesn't love the minister more than the cook, or the teacher more than the gardenerÂHe loves them equally because they are all a part of Him. One person is not more important than the other, because they are all needed: one nourishes the spirit, one feeds the body, one opens the mind, and one makes His house beautiful. God is fair because He gives ""to each according to his own ability."" More talents may seem like more blessings and love, but it actually equates more responsibility. Regardless of our duties or the amount of responsibility we carry, we need to use our talents to edify others and to glorify God. So from a spiritual perspective, a talent is a God-given gift. God may expect us to use it in a certain way, but it's essentially a gift. And in the spirit of a gift, He grants us the freedom to exercise our will in determining the if, when, and how of its use. The Servants Though a talent is a gift, and though we can choose how to put it to use, there still is a right way and a wrong way of doing things, as exemplified by the servants in the parable. The ""good and faithful"" servants, the ones who received the five and the two talents, were the ones who invested their talents and earned more money for their master. They were ""good"" because they knew the will of their master and cherished their talents by using them to the best of their abilities. The servant who received the five talents did not flaunt his abundance or lord it over the other two servants because he received the most money; neither did the servant with the two talents complain about receiving less. Rather, both had one goal and one goal onlyÂto be profitable servants. They were ""faithful"" because, entrusted with the estate, they fulfilled their duties and made it flourish. By being industrious, they doubled what they received and gave everything they earned to their master. The ""wicked and lazy"" servant, on the other hand, buried his one talent in the ground. This action alone shows the blatant disregard he had for that one talent. Never mind that a talent took a lifetime to earnÂhe felt slighted because he received less than the other servants. Out of spite and laziness, he let the money sit idle rather than putting it in the bank to earn interest, even though he ""knew"" his master to be a ""hard man."" And to compound his wickedness, he tried to justify his actions by blaming them on his master's character! The Bible tells us that servants should be ""faithful"" and ""obedient to those who are [their] masters"" (1 Cor 4:2; Eph 6:5). As Christians, we are ""servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God"" (1 Cor 4:1). Therefore, we must also serve the Lord faithfully and obey His commands, ""not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men"" (Eph 6:6-7). Like the servants with the five and the two talents, we need to understand the will of our master, the Lord, and actually do it. We should not emulate the servant with the one talent, who professed to know his master but found an excuse to shirk his duties. Paul tells us that because Jesus died to save us, ""if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's"" (Rom 14:8). And since He was bruised, beaten, and battered for our sake, it is now our duty to care for His body, the Church. God's love for us truly knows no bounds! As if it were not enough that Jesus redeemed us from sin, God even gave us each a different gift to assist with our duty. Our gift may be as spectacular as five talents or as seemingly insignificant as one talentÂit may even be only half a talent. Regardless, we all received something. The point here is not how much we have received but whether or not we put what we have to use. We can choose to use our gifts to glorify the Lord, like the good and faithful servants did, or we can let them stagnate, like the servant with the one talent did. But just because we have only one talent does not mean that we cannot be productive. We all have a skill that can be used for the benefit of the Lord. What seems trivial to us may actually be important to the Lord. ""No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.... But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it, that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another"" (1 Cor 12:22-25). We should not look down on our one talentÂnor, for that matter, should we look down on anyone else's one talent, because that talent is as essential as any other talents in making the Lord's body whole. The Reward and Punishment It seems incomprehensible that one talent could hold as great an importance as five talents, but let's look at the situation from the master's perspective. The master's purpose in giving the talents to the servants was so that they could earn more talents. After settling the accounts, he rewarded the two servants who earned more talents, and he disowned the one who hid his talent in the ground. On the surface, it seems as if the master was a hard taskmaster, judging the servants solely on the basis of whether or not they made money. Yet he said ""Well done"" to both the servant who earned five talents and the servant who earned two, made both ""[rulers] over many things,"" and allowed both to ""enter into the joy of [their] lord."" If he had been concerned with only the amount of money they each made, then the servant who earned the five talents would have received greater honor. Apparently, money is not the issue. Faithfulness, however, is. The master's praise of the two good servants stems from the fact that both were ""faithful over a few things."" Compared with each other, the servant with the five talents obviously made more money, but compared with what they each received, both made a profit of 100 percent. In the master's eyes, both had fulfilled their duties. So his rebuke of the lazy servant with ""you ought to have"" indicates that the servant was derelict in his duties. The master expected to receive something for his one talent; even with that talent sitting in the bank, he says, ""I would have received back my own with interest."" But the servant was so ""wicked and lazy"" that he did not even have interest to show for his labor (or lack thereof). Whether we have one or two or five talents, we each have the potential to give 100 percent of our effort to the Lord. Just as the ""good and faithful"" servants gave everything they earned to the Lord, so we, ""whether [we] eat or drink, or whatever [we] do,"" must ""do all to the glory of God"" (1 Cor 10:31). And that, in a nutshell, is our dutyÂto glorify God. As members of God's body, we represent Him to the world. Our speech, behavior, and actions all reflect upon Him. Thus, we must use the gifts we have at our disposal to add to, rather than detract from, His glory. ""Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights...that we may be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures"" (Jas 1:17-18). If the fruits we bear attest to our character, then we should strive to be perfect, because by being perfect we, as the fruits of God's labor, show others that God is perfect. In the end, God will reward us for our faithfulness. If we show Him that we can be ""faithful over a few things,"" then He will make us ""ruler over many things."" By doing what we were supposed to do anyway, we will be blessed, ""for to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance."" In short, the more responsibilities we fulfill, or the more fruits we bear, the more responsibilities God will entrust to us, and the more blessings He will give us to fulfill our duties. Furthermore, we will be able to ""enter into the joy of [our] lord."" So when our time on earth is done, our faithfulness will have led us into the heavenly kingdom. We must take care not to let our gifts lie idle, because the less we use them, the fewer blessings we will receive. This relentless cycle will continue until we become barren, and ""from him who does not have, even what he was will be taken away."" Without fruits to show for our labor, our talents become useless, and God will take away what little responsibility He entrusted to us in the first place and give it to someone else. Not only will we be left destitute, but we will also be ""cast...into the outer darkness."" There should be no doubt in our minds what that ""darkness"" will be. Faithfulness takes time to express. So before we decide to put off our work for the Lord until the last five years of our life, we should keep in mind that there is no lottery, no single great feat that can proclaim, ""Lord, I have been faithful."" Only God can tell us how faithful we have been, but, unfortunately, that won't happen until Judgment Day. We can, however, take every opportunity to serve Him with love. We can start to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven, perhaps enough so that it won't matter when Jesus decides to visit usÂnext year, or tomorrow, or today. If we try our best to express our love through faithfulness, then He will also say to us, ""Well done, good and faithful servant."""
1,443,Temptation or Test?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1660-pub.html,"Temptation or Test? Let no one say when he is tempted, ""I am tempted by God""; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death. âJames 1:13-15 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. âJames 1:2-4 Have you ever been in a situation where you felt that the forces against you were so overwhelming that you could just give in any moment? Two paths lay ahead, to obey God or not, to remain true to Him or not. Moses once said to the children of Israel, ""See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil"" (Deut 30:15). If only things were always so clear! Why does good and evil often seem to merge so maddeningly before us, so that we are left in confusion, so that what is wrong might be right if it were just looked at from another angle, or if we shut our eyes to what we know ought to be? James, who was gifted with a rare wisdom, perceived that we often do not possess sufficient knowledge of ourselves and of the situations that we find ourselves in. This leads to weakness and eventually spiritual defeat. In the worst case, not being able to see a temptation for what it is, or not being able to perceive a test with all of God's higher will behind it, could mean the difference between spiritual life and death. Since the stakes are so high, we had better take a close look at the spiritual realities of temptation and test. What Is Temptation? Temptation is evil, and leads us to evil. James uses a reverse definition, by first telling us what it is not, and where it does not come from. Lest some believers accuse God of leading them into temptation, James says that God ""cannot be tempted with evil and He Himself tempts no one."" The very definition of God precludes the possibility of evil. Jesus, as is well known, could not be tempted to sin. And correspondingly, God will not tempt His children. James describes God as ""the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning"" (Jas 1:17). Where, then, does temptation come from? Temptation comes when a person ""is lured and enticed by his own desire."" This brings us closer to the heart of temptation, and hence evil's origin. Because each of us has a fallen nature inherited from our forefathers, who first sinned, we have the inclination within us to do evil, just as we have the aspiration to do good. We are pulled in both directions, and often succumb to evil. Ultimately, temptation can be traced to Satan, who has been called in the Bible, the Father of Lies, the Accuser, the Evil One. All these are simply titles, and the Bible portrays Satan in a number of guises, from serpent to dragon. Whatever the form, what is being represented is the sheer force of evil, all that is not of God and that works towards sin and death; not just death of the flesh, but of the Spirit. Evil gives rise to inclinations, and then to action. Paul says, ""Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God"" (Gal 5:19 -21). Although the above may seem to be a list of things that obviously none of us would ever do, think againâfor sin does not originate in the act itself, but somewhere further back. Perhaps it seems innocent to read a certain book, watch a certain movie, talk to certain friends. Yet often, it is from these small actions of ours everyday that we allow ourselves to move on to situations where we see, hear and think things that are contrary to Christian beliefs. These are not harmless, but like tiny viruses, they implant within us the tiniest tendencies to commit sin. If we do not constantly examine ourselves and purify ourselves through prayer and the Word of God, these tendencies will lead to sin, perhaps only years later. That is why Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, cautions us to not only not kill, but not even to hate; to not only not commit adultery, but not even to think lustful thoughts. As James says in his letter, there is another insidious type of evilâthe good we have neglected to do. In Jesus' chilling parable of the sheep and the goats, He chastises the goats, or those whom He has condemned, not so much for the sins they had committed, but for the good they failed to do: For I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me. (Mt 25:42-43) Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me. (Mt 25:45) We can be tempted to sin. We can also be tempted by being lulled into being smug and thinking all is well, when in fact we may be like the lukewarm church that Jesus rebukes in the Book of Revelation and threatens to spew from His mouth. What Is a Test? ""In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ"" (1 Pet 1:6-7). Tests strengthen us spiritually. They may be some form of suffering at the hands of others or at the mercy of a general circumstance. They may arise precisely at the moment when we are doing right in the eyes of God. We may be tested in all kinds of things, but the important point to note is that tests can ultimately be of benefit to us if we can endure. There is always a lesson that can be learned. Enduring the company of an unwelcome companion may bring forth the fruit of patience. Suffering an illness may bring us closer to seeing what is important in lifeâGod and the work of the kingdom, rather than our own material gratification; seeking God's will rather than our own. Just as God tested Job to reveal his self-righteousness, He will give each of us tests according to what needs improvement within us. Let us note a relationship between temptation and test that is quite subtle. The case of Job is a good example to illustrate how closely these two often operate. Satan intended to tempt Job. God intended to use Satan to test Job. Job saw only the evil that was happening to him and all around. If his thoughts and feelings had appealed to his weaknesses in the fleshâfor example, if he had the desire for bodily comfort or wealth, he would have produced a situation where he would be tempted to forsake God. Succumbing to that temptation, he would have been rejected by God. If, on the other hand, he were able to endure, and let the evil remain external to himself rather than springing forth from within him, then he would have turned the situation into a test, from which he could, with God's help, emerge victorious. It can be the case that one person's test is another person's temptation. How to Overcome Temptations and Pass through Tests ""No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it"" (1 Cor 10:13). The cardinal principle here is that God will not allow us to fail. Certainly, we have the inclination for both good and evil. This is known as yetzer in Hebrew, meaning the root of good and root of evil, which inclines us sometimes towards one and at other times towards the other. But God has promised that as long as we have the determination to walk in the path of the good, He will see to it that we succeed. We must have this kind of faith, always. Secondly, when we are faced with a difficult situation, whether temptation or test, we need only to get ourselves out of that immediate situation to a place or a state of mind where we can reflect and, more importantly, pray for guidance. In Genesis 39, when Joseph was being tempted by Potiphar's wife, he first directly repudiated the evil by saying, ""How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"" However, there was a point beyond which direct confrontation is useless. Joseph knew this, and thus at a later point, he simply fled from the scene so that he would not be subjected to further temptation. The example of Joseph shows us two approaches, one of direct confrontation, the other of avoidance. Both are necessary, and we just need to know when to use which. The next step is to pray to God for guidance. God can renew our strength to resist evil or endure suffering. God can show us the way that He wants us to tread. Of course, we should not wait till we are in dangerous situations before we resort to prayer, we should be building the habit of daily prayer as a preventive measure, as a bulwark against situations that we cannot foresee. As a well-loved hymn goes, Oh, how prayer rests the weary. Prayer can turn the night to day. So, in sorrow and in gladness, don't forget to pray. Thirdly, when the situation is past, let us ask, ""What can I learn from this situation? What can I learn about my own weakness, and how can I overcome it? What can I learn that will add to my spiritual character and help me thrive in the future?"" If we do not learn from our mistakes, we will only face the same situation again some time down the road. Finally, all of the things we have been discussing have been in a more negative vein. Avoiding temptation. Overcoming tests. But the mere absence of evil in our hearts is not enough. For as physical nature abhors a vacuum, so does the spiritual nature. We are like empty vessels that may be filled with both good and evil. If we remove something that is evil, we need to make sure that we are always filled with the good. If a person quits smoking, for example, he suddenly has extra time and energy in his hands. Why not put them to good use, such as making a commitment to exercise or taking up a hobby? In the same way, we must strive to replace our spiritual weaknesses, one by one, with spiritual virtues. Contrary to the works of the flesh, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Gal 5:22-23). We need to have a rich spiritual life. A rich spiritual life consists of daily prayers and study of the Word of God. It is one that makes us belong to the body of Christ, the church. It is striving to manifest God's love in our lives. It is not enough for us to simply not be evil, or simply be a benign presence in the world. It matters who we are, and what we do. May God guide us in our Christian life, and give us the wisdom to discern what is temptation and what is test, and strength to overcome both. Whatever may come our way, we will strive towards the perfection of our spirit for the glory of our Lord. Amen."

Almost everybody loves money and loves to talk about moneyâhow to get it, what to do with it, or who has it. You also do not need to push your child to study too hard. The very day your child steps into a classroom, he is already on a conveyor belt that goes at an ever increasing speed until he reaches the other end with a degree or until he drops out. Strangely, many Christian parents, like other parents, stress the importance of a good career and a good education to excess. What does God want Christian parents to tell their children? First we must understand this fact: children are a heritage from the Lord (Ps 127:3). Your child belongs to God. God makes you a guardian and places the child under your care. Your child is not yours for you to mold as you desire. Your child is not an extension of yourself to fulfill your dreams. Your child is God's heritage for you to bring up in the way of the Lord to achieve this supreme plan. From the beginning this was God's charge to Abraham as a parent: For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice, that the Lord may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him. (Gen 18:19) Note that God did not charge Abraham to charge his children to get milk and honey. Abraham was to command his children to keep the way of the Lord, and they would be blessed with a land flowing with milk and honey as the Lord promised. The same charge was laid upon the nation of Israel when Moses repeated the laws of God in the wilderness: And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. (Deut 6:6-7) This same charge now applies to you as a parent. When you are with your kids, what do you talk about? Asaph the psalmist speaks of Telling the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength, and His wonderful works that He has done... that they may set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments. (Ps 78:4-7) Emphasize the way of the Lord. Impress in the mind of your children the laws of God, so that they will set her hope in God. A person whose hope is in God will not be moved. Speak to them about the glorious deeds of the Lord and all the good things God has bestowed on your family. Let your children know that the Lord is good. Teach them to trust in God and warn against disobeying God. God is a God of love. God is also a God of justice. When a person disobeys God, God will punish. Your children must learn this. If you accept that this is your duty as a parent, then the next time your child asks, ""What shall I be?"", you will say, ""You are a child of God to be used by Him as He wills."" These are merely words, however, if your actions do not confirm that you really believe what you have said. Children learn so much from what you do and what you say. When you say that it is important to put God first in everything and yet tell them that they may stay at home to study instead of going to church for services or for religious education classes, you are confusing your child by sending conflicting messages. Parents must realize that attending church services, including religious education classes, has never adversely affected a Christian youth's studies. I have been baptized for about 20 years and have worked with Christian youths for not less than 15 years but I have never known or heard of a Christian youth whose studies suffered because they attended church services. On the other hand, I have seen many active Christian youths who excel in their studies. Therefore when you teach your children the importance of worship, it is your duty to show them you mean what you say by actually bringing them to church or encouraging them to attend religious education classes on their own. In this way, you are giving a clear message that God is most important. The same applies to all other teachings you impart to your child. You must show by your example what you teach."
1,455,The Spirit of Truth or the Spirit of Error?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1672-pub.html,"The Spirit of Truth or the Spirit of Error? One of the greatest dangers of the end times is the coming of many antichrists. The apostle John cautioned the believers in one of his letters: Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour. (1 Jn 1:18) John was writing to believers because he addressed the readers as âlittle childrenâ or âbeloved.â This means that even believers of the Lord Jesus Christ may fall for the deception of the Antichrist. Because of this alarming possibility, John taught us not to believe but to test every spirit to check whether it is of God: Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. (1 Jn 4:1) Behind the works of the antichrists is the spirit of the antichrist, which John also calls, âthe spirit of errorâ (1 Jn 4:6). The spirit of error, which comes from the devil, seeks to deceive the world and lead people away from Christ. But are not believers given the power to overcome the evil one? Doesnât Johnâs epistle confidently assert that believers have the anointing in them and that they know all things (1 Jn 2:20)? Does he not also say that the evil one does not touch those who have been born of God (1 Jn 5:18)? Why, then, do we need to beware of the antichrists and the spirit of error? Indeed, God, who lives in us, has given us all that we need to overcome the forces of evil. âYou are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the worldâ (1Jn 4:4). For whatever is born of God overcomes the worldâ¦ Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?â (1 Jn 5:4-5) Nevertheless, believers may still voluntarily follow the enticement of the devil. The devil cannot touch us, but he can deceive us so that we relinquish the guidance of Godâs spirit and willfully carry out his desires. Oftentimes, the works of the spirit of error may appear to be similar to the works of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, thereby confusing the world and believers who are not watchful. This is why John warns us not to believe in every spirit but to test the spirits to see if they are of God. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ERROR AND FALSEHOOD It is interesting that John did not contrast the âspirit of truthâ with the âspirit of falsehood.â Instead, he calls the deceiving spirit the âspirit of error.â The dictionary defines âerrorâ as âan act, assertion, or belief that unintentionally deviates from what is correct, right, or true.â Whereas âfalsehoodâ denotes something that is outright wrong, âerrorâ implies an innocent (or seemingly innocent) mistake or a deviation from what is true. When a person makes an error, it is often not because he doesnât know what is right. He may have been misled into thinking that he was doing the right thing. Or maybe he was simply not careful enough. It is this kind of deviation that we, as believers, need to look out for. While the result of an error may not always be fatal, those who make an âerrorâ will certainly suffer loss. This is why our Lord repeatedly reminds us to guard what we have received until He comes: âAnd he who overcomes, and keeps my works until the endâ¦â (Rev 2:26) ââ¦Hold fast what you haveâ¦â (Rev 3:11) âBehold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.â (Rev 16:15) Complacency and self-confidence easily open the door to error. That is why we have to test the spirits, guard ourselves against the works of the spirit of error, and obey the Spirit of God. Then we will not jeopardize our rewards at the coming of our Lord. Spirits are invisible and intangible to us. So how can we test the spirits? We can do so by testing the manifestations of a spirit. Since a spirit works through people, we can discern the works of the spirit of error by looking at the thoughts, words, and actions of those who are under its influence. John gives us three tests by which to do so. WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE? â¦Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world. (1 Jn 4:2-3) The work of the spirit of the Antichrist denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. In Johnâs days, false teachers preached that God could not have come in the flesh because all flesh is evil. This heresy undermined the fundamental Christian belief that God became flesh and dwelled among us (Jn 1:14). As believers, we know that Jesus took on the same flesh and blood as us to destroy the devil and release those under the devilâs control (Heb 2:14). He offered his body as an atonement for our sins, through which we are sanctified (Heb 10:10). This is why John taught that if anyone denies that Jesus has come in the flesh, he is not of God but is of the spirit of the Antichrist. In those days, the antichrists at first mingled with the true believers of God (1 Jn 2:19). They confessed that Jesus was Lord and went in and out with other Christians. But, as time went on, they began to question the incarnation of Jesus Christ. They did not challenge Jesusâ lordship but taught that Jesusâ coming into the world was merely a spiritual manifestation. This was a subtle and seemingly logical shift from the original teachings of the apostles. Eventually, they left the congregation of believers because of this difference in belief and formed their own group. Today, we may not hear of anyone who professes to believe in Jesus Christ proclaiming also that He did not come in the flesh, but the work of the spirit of the Antichrist is still prevalentâit has just taken on different forms. In what ways does the spirit of error manifest itself in peopleâs beliefs today? More than One Way to Salvation The spirit of error can come under the guise of love and acceptance. âGod is love. He accepts you regardless of what you believe.â Godâs love has somehow become a justification for not believing Jesus Christ. It has also given people the license to condemn those who preach Jesus as the only way of salvation. Preaching that Jesus is the only way to God is considered âthe wrong thing to doâ in popular culture today. When we give such a message, we are immediately accused of judging and condemning other people and religions. People want to believe and hear that God will accept you as long as you are a good person, regardless of whether you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. Some may concede that Jesus was perhaps indeed God in the flesh, but they object the moment they hear that Jesus is the ONLY way to salvation. In the eyes of many people in the world, those who preach Jesus Christ as the only way are narrow-minded and judgmental. The world hates those who teach the truth of salvation but welcome those who believe, âWe should agree to disagree,â or âAll religions are trueâ or âWhat is true for you may not be true for me.â Is this not the kind of half-truth that the antichrists confessed in the days of John? The spirit of error agrees that itâs a âgood thingâ to believe in Jesus, as long as you donât preach that Christ is the only way to God. While this type of belief appears to be noble, it is in fact the hideous work of the spirit of error because it misleads. It seeks to subvert the fundamental message of the gospel and intimidates us from speaking the truth. Our Lord Jesus Christ proclaimed unequivocally, âI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Meâ (Jn 14:6). Besides Jesus Christ, there is simply no other way. As loving as our Lord Jesus was, He told the people, âHe who believes in [Godâs Son] is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of Godâ (Jn 3:17). The apostles of the Lord also preached the same message faithfully: âNor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be savedâ (Acts 4:12). As the children of God, we ought to test the spirits and see the error of those popular beliefs that are contrary to the truth. Let us hold fast to the Word that we have believed and boldly confess that Jesus Christ and His atoning death is the only way to God. WHAT DO THEY SAY? They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. (1Jn 4:5) Those who are led by the spirit of error âspeak as of the world.â What does this mean? âThe worldâ is the unbelieving world, including all that is contrary to the will of the Father in heaven. For all that is in the worldâthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of lifeâis not of the Father but is of the world. (1Jn 2:16) The spirit of error is at work in this unbelieving world, for the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one (1 Jn 5:19). Those who are of this world speak the things according to the will of the evil one. What they speak or teach are things that appeal to our selfish desiresâthings that oppose the will of God. This is not to say that everything we hear or learn in the world is evil. The human race has contributed much good to this world, such as science, medicine, technology, and the arts. In our society, we also often see people who set excellent examples or exhibit moral courage, diligence, wisdom, and self- sacrifice. All these are positive things for us to learn and imitate. But the spirit of error often makes use of things that seem to be positive to inject certain philosophies, values, and attitudes that are actually contrary to the teachings of God. The spirit of the antichrists may not necessarily speak out directly against Christ, but it may lead people away from Christ with false teachings that appear to be based on Christian beliefs. It can teach greed in the name of diligence, pride in the name of confidence, and lust in the name of love. Self-help books and videos are everywhere nowadays. Book titles that carry instructions like âHow to Lose Weight in 10 Daysâ and âHow to Succeed in Your Careerâ have become bestsellers. On infomercials, we hear testimonials of people whose lives have been changed by following the advice offered in similar videos or books. People attend motivational seminars to better themselves or achieve certain goals. One common message in many of these products or seminars is âBelieve in yourself.â People are taught to tell themselves that they can do whatever they set out to do, even in the face of the impossible. Those who are successful made their dreams possible because they believed in themselves. Determination and persistence are positive values. In fact, the Bible encourages Christians to nurture such values. But when they are used to teach the pursuit of material wealth or personal ambitions, they cannot be of God. Confidence is good, but when God is removed from the picture, confidence becomes pride, for the Bible teaches us to put our trust and confidence in the Lord, not in ourselves. So before we eagerly embrace the seemingly noble teachings that we hear, we need to test the principles and premises behind them to see if they are of God or of the world. WHAT DO THEY OBEY? One other way to test the spirits is to look at whether they are obedient to the truth. Those who are of God heed the teachings of Christ and of the apostles. But those who are under the sway of the spirit of error refuse to abide by the truth, even if they confess with their mouths that they are Christians. Our Lord Jesus has warned us that not everyone who calls Him âLord, Lordâ will enter the kingdom of heaven. On that day, He will say to many professed Christians and workers of God that He never knew them because of their disobedience (Mt 7:15-20). Ultimately, it is not just what a person professes or teaches that determines whether he is of the Spirit of truth, but whether he carries out the will of the heavenly Father. Superficial Religion Among the greatest deceptions of the end times is that of superficial religion. This is also the mark of the antichrists, who put on a cloak of religion but do not accept or practice the truth. They are guided by the spirit of error, which attempts to fool Christians into having a form of godliness without yielding to the teachings of Christ. Paul told Timothy that there would come a time when people would not be interested in hearing the genuine teachings of God: For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. (2 Tim 4:3-4) Those who follow the spirit of error have a form of godliness, but they have no intention to hear or obey Godâs word. Rather than humbly accept the sound doctrine, they choose for themselves what they like to hear. We must not fall into this kind of false piety. When I visited a country in Asia last year, I learned about a growing phenomenon there. Many people flock to worship services organized by preachers who choose not to associate with any particular congregation. These preachers, who are charismatic speakers, occasionally conduct services at very grand hotels. People are attracted to such Sunday services because of the luxurious hotel settings, the refreshments that follow, and the eloquence of the speakers. Because of its popularity, such services also help generate a good amount of income for these preachers. There is certainly nothing wrong with having worship services or teaching the Bible at five-star hotels. However, we cannot but wonder whether people are attracted to such events because they are sincerely interested in knowing Godâs will and in obeying His word. The work of the spirit of error can affect any believerâwhether we are a new believer or a loyal minister. It can deceive us to into believing that we are good Christians, when we have not accepted the complete gospel of salvation or been truly born again. It can deceive us into thinking that we are actively serving the Lord, when our personal conduct is far from the teachings of the Scriptures. The spirit of error deceives us into satisfying ourselves with superficial religion, so that we become too complacent with merely an outward appearance of piety. Without constant watchfulness through Godâs word and His Spirit, we can easily stray from the truth while still believing that we are being fervent in the Lord. But those who are serious about their faith are not content with just attending church or even preaching in the name of Christ. True believers hear the Spirit of truth so that they might truly know Godâs will and walk according to it. If our heart is inclined towards Jesus and we want to follow and obey His teachings wholeheartedly, His Spirit of truth will guide us into all truths through His Holy Spirit (Jn 16:13). This is how we can remain in the Lord and avoid falling into the errors of the antichrists. May our hearts be always in tune with the teachings of the Lord and may our lives be ever responsive to the guidance of the Spirit of truth. Then, when the Lord appears, âwe may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His comingâ (1 Jn 2:28)."
1,461,Do We Care?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1678-pub.html,"Do We Care? In the past few years, attention has been drawn repeatedly to the plight of the people in Africa. Newspapers have reported how famine, war, and debt are threatening the lives of hundreds of million people there. In Somalia, the situation was so severe that relief workers rounded numbers of the dead to the nearest 10,000. 1.5 million of the country's estimated 6 million faced imminent starvation. Drought and disease have plagued the continent, leaving behind devastation. But Africa is only one example. In the floods that swept Pakistan in September 1992, at least 2,500 people were drowned. This natural disaster, one of the worst in 45 years, destroyed innumerable villages, food crops and livestock, and left tens of thousands homeless. Relief organizations had to airlift food and subsistence for these victims. To us, these crises may seem far removed from our every day life. So many have occurred in recent years that we have come to accept them as nothing more than just another piece of news, another set of statistics to support the view that the Lord's second coming is near. Besides, places like Africa and Pakistan are like a world apart from those of us living in stable, affluent societies. However, poverty, homelessness and deprivation exist even in our own backyards. As Christians, do we have an obligation to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings? Indeed, our hearts may be moved when we are confronted with malnourished faces staring hauntingly at us from our television screens. And we feel sorry for the homeless that wander around in our cities begging and living in cardboard boxes for protection at night. But are such expressions of sympathy on our part sufficient? Doesn't God expect us to do more? There are children rejected by their parents, elderly men and women forgotten by their families, people who through no fault of their own have found themselves jobless and even homeless. Such human suffering and social deprivation exists all around us, if only we take the time to look. As part of His divine plan, God incarnated into the human plane some two thousand years ago to open a way for humanity to return to Him. He achieved this through the blood He shed on the cross. When a person confesses his sins, repents, and receives baptism in the mode as prescribed by the Bible, he will have the living hope of eternal life. Yet more than this, while Jesus was in this world, He also led an exemplary life for all future generations to emulate. If we are to follow Him, we have to walk the way He did (Jn 12:26). In order to search for a Christian answer for the questions posed above, we have to return to the Scripture. During His brief ministry, the Lord Jesus traveled through the land of Palestine, from Galilee in the north to Judea in the south. Along His journeys, He encountered many lost souls who, deprived of God, were wandering aimlessly through life. Accordingly, He preached to them about the kingdom of God (Mt 4:17) and the need to repent and be reconciled once again with God. But Jesus did not preach this message in oblivion of everything else. He also catered to the physical well-being of those around Him. As the Scripture testifies, He performed miracles of food to feed the crowd (Mt 14:13-21; 15:32-38), and miracles of healing to relieve human suffering (Mt 4:23-24; 15:30). The author of Matthew aptly summarizes the Lord's ministry as one of preaching and healing (Mt 4:23; 9:35). What is more, the message of salvation and the miracles were not confined to the Jews. Jesus' disciples had to ""go and make disciples of all nations"" (Mt 28:19). In the last days, men ""will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit down in the kingdom of God"" (Lk 13:29). Just as the message of salvation was universal, so were the miracles. As He fed the four thousand, He did not instruct His disciples to distribute only to His own people. All who were present received a share of this providential care (Mt 15:29-38). In Capernaum, He did not turn down the request of the centurion to heal his servant (Mt 8:5-13). And once traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee, He healed ten lepers, one of whom was a Samaritan, a member of a community which did not associate with the Jews (Lk 17:11-19; Jn 4:9). In many instances, the Lord Jesus' actions were prompted by His compassion. Time and time again, the Gospel writers attested to this fact. When He saw the widow of Nain mourning for her son's death, Luke states that Jesus ""had compassion on her"" and resurrected her son (Lk 7:13). The author of Mark relates that during the early days of His ministry, a leper approached Jesus for healing, and his request was granted because Jesus was ""moved with pity"" for him (Mk 1:40-41). Once, as Jesus was leaving Jericho, two blind men sitting by the roadside heard Him passing and cried out for help. Matthew records that Jesus ""in pity"" healed them (Mt 20:29-34). Even the feeding of the four thousand was an act of compassion. When Jesus saw how the crowds continued to stay with Him, He admitted to His disciples that He had compassion for the crowd and was unwilling to send them away on empty stomachs. As they had been with Him for three days, He feared that they might faint along their journey home (Mt 15:32-39). As previously illustrated, Jesus cared for his fellowmen and did what He could for them. And in this respect, the greatest deed He undertook was the giving of His life in exchange for their souls. Deeply moved by this gesture, the apostle Paul confessed that the reason he lived a God-centered life was that Jesus, the Son of God, loved him and gave Himself for him (Gal 2:20). Today, it is through this gift of God that we have the hope of eternal life, and which enables us to lead a meaningful existence in this often incomprehensible world. As we meditate on this saving grace, we also have to remember that we, as His followers, have to emulate Him, and practice charity as part of our Christian living. Indeed, the Lord Jesus has taught us the essence of giving, that such acts should be prompted by our hearts. After all, Christianity is a religion of the heart, of faith built upon inner conviction. It involves knowing whom and what we believe in, and manifesting this belief through our speech and our conduct. In this manner, we can testify to the world that we are the followers of the One who came to bring hope to a world without hope. So it should be that from our innermost being, the compassion in us is to be externalized into actions. Only then will we be able to give to humanity whatever is within our ability, not because we have to, but because we want to. Jesus has shown us that compassion itself is insufficient. He not only had compassion for the needy, but actually helped them. As He traveled, He saw the human miseries that touched His kind and tender nature. And He did what He could to remove the pain and suffering. As His followers, we have to turn our feelings of compassion and sympathy into actions to find ways of helping and giving. After all, it is very easy to feel for those who are less fortunate but it takes courage to actively help them. Just consider, how many times have we stopped short of contributing to some worthwhile charity? Perhaps we were just about to write a check for a good cause, but we stopped when we thought of the financial loss to us. Or perhaps we had joined a task force to care for the homeless, but pulled out when we realized the demand on our time. Another touching feature in the Lord Jesus' acts is in the way He gave without condition. He did not select the recipients of His care. The crowd, irrespective of gender and creed, received His grace. As His followers, this point is important. We are to extend our charity, without bias, to all who are in need, just as our heavenly Father gives sunshine and rain to both the righteous as well as the unrighteous (Mt 5:45). As Christians, we are still part of society. While we have to be vigilant and not be influenced by society's decadence and falling morals, we cannot segregate ourselves. The Lord Jesus wants us to be the ""light of the world""; to set good examples such that others can see Him in us. We can only achieve this through social interaction with them. Therefore, let us not isolate ourselves, but instead strive to increase our awareness of society's needs. We should not only be concerned for their spiritual welfare, but also their daily well-being. While we do not wish to give to the extent where our focus shifts from the spiritual to the social, we must not let a lack of caring make our preaching hypocritical (Is 2:14-16). And when we do take a closer look at the world around us, we will see the depressed, the homeless, the handicapped, the abused, the poor...the list is endless. How can we not care and help? The time has come for us to reassess the meaning of following in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus. He had a compassionate and caring nature, led a life of giving, and contributed to the society of His day. Have we really emulated Him? The Christian faith is a dynamic faith, one which constantly breaks new ground and soars to new heights. As we learn more about the God we believe in and His expectations of us, let us search our hearts and reappraise our values. Let us take the opportunity while we still can and lend a helping hand to neighbors less fortunate than us and show them that we care. Let us not turn a blind eye at the miseries of this world. Christians, like their kind and compassionate Master, have to live up to the axiom: ""It is more blessed to give than to receive"" (Acts 20:35)."
1,504,Serving God in My Youth: Self-Doubt or Self Confidence?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1721-pub.html,"Serving God in My Youth: Self-Doubt or Self Confidence? Youth. Youth plus college. Youth plus college plus church work. Does this sound familiar? In an ideal world, laboring for the Lord is smooth and victorious. In reality, unfortunately, being entrusted with holy work usually creates stress. The life of a student often is a constant struggle to balance the demands of schoolwork, friends, and activities. The life of a Christian student carries with it the added requirements of setting aside time for spiritual cultivation and holy work. There are times when we may find ourselves hesitant to accept certain responsibilities, not because we are too busy (although we might claim as such) but because there is something within ourselves that is holding us back. What is that something? SELF DOUBT Before we answer this question, let us first examine some commonly held stereotypes about youths. On one extreme, college students are seen as lost soulsâfilled with uncertainty about what they like and who they are, and riddled with doubt about their own self-worth and capabilities. On the other extreme, students are portrayed as overconfident know-it-alls, who, regardless of whether or not they really do know it all, have no respect for the advice of elders or those in authority. When I started college, I began to attend youth Bible studies held every Friday night. An informal list of names was put together, and those less-than-a-dozen youths would each take a turn to lead the Bible study. Although I was a religious education teacher and had had some other teaching experience, I was filled with fear at the thought of having to lead a Bible study for the first time. Since most of the youths were taking turns to lead, I was soon asked to also take part. My first reaction, fortunately not expressed aloud, was, âyeah right!â My attitude stemmed not from laziness or defiance, but rather from a âwho, me?â type of mindset. What right did I have to tell other people, some of whom were several years older than I was, what to do? I didnât even know what to do myself sometimes! However, after awkwardly resisting several gentle requests to add my name to the schedule, I finally agreed, realizing that this was a duty that the other youths had willingly and even joyfully accepted. For some, leading an informal youth Bible study might not seem like such a big deal, but for others, the mere thought of it can be enough to set off the butterflies in our stomach. In my case, public speaking wasnât particularly a problem, but I had little faith in myself and doubted that I could edify others. Although I donât quite remember the specific details about what leading Bible study for the first time was like, I do know that, despite my concerns, things ran relatively smoothly. The week leading up to my turn to lead a Bible study, I found myself becoming more worried. Yet, instead of letting my inabilities inhibit me, I found myself drawing closer to God as I asked Him for help. What I came to realize through this small but not insignificant experience was that self-doubt could hinder our spiritual progress if we allow ourselves to be consumed by worries over our inadequacies. Depending on God If we channel that self-doubt into dependence on God, we can actually be quite successful. In fact, many great figures in the Bible who were called by God did not possess extraordinary gifts or talents. Some even possess certain traits that we would think might hinder their work. For example, Moses himself was reluctant to lead the Israelites because he was âslow of speech and slow of tongueâ (Ex 4:10). A person who characterizes himself right off the bat as an ineloquent speaker hardly seems like the ideal choice for someone who would be expected to persuade well over a half-million Israelites, excluding women and children, to risk their lives to follow him and who had to first convince the Pharaoh to set them free (Ex 12:37). Similarly, when chosen to be the leader of the Israelites, both Gideon and Saul replied that they were from the smallest tribes of Israel, of the least important clan within those tribes, and, as Gideon himself stated, was the least within his own family (Judg 6:15). Choosing an unlikely candidate to assume an important role seems illogical, but Godâs methods are profound. When we are aware of our own limitations, we rely on God to make up for our deficienciesâin essence, when we are weak, we are strong. Furthermore, others can see Godâs work and glorify His name. If God had chosen a fearless, charismatic leader to save the Israelites from their bondage, it is quite possible that many might have put their faith in that person and not in God. By choosing workers whom the majority of people would consider to be the least likely, others can see that subsequent victories are clearly the result of Godâs almighty power and not that of man. As 1 Cor 1:27-28, 30 explains: For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty... that no flesh should glory in His presence. Having Faith in His Power If we do not know to turn to God with our insecurities and continue to doubt ourselves, we actually doubt God. While we may have faith in Godâs existence, if we cannot believe that God can help us, we, in effect, doubt that Godâs almighty power can change us. For instance, when Peter stepped onto the water to meet Jesus, he began to sink when he saw the boisterous wind and waves about him. Jesus then rebuked him, saying, âO you of little faith, why did you doubt?â However, Peter did believe in Jesusâ saving power, for as soon as he began to sink, he immediately cried out, âLord, save me!â So why did Jesus scold Peter for his lack of faith? Because without the confidence that Godâs abidance makes all things possible, our faith is incomplete. SELF-CONFIDENCE So letâs say that weâve pretty much gotten over our self-doubt and are ready to take on some more holy work. Does confidence in our own abilities to serve God mean that we are being proud? Again, that all depends upon what we decide to do with that self-confidence. Relying on My Own Effort After having become more comfortable with leading Bible studies on Friday nights and occasionally with a small group during Sabbath services, and also having been given the opportunity to lead various types of religious education activities, I began to recognize that I had certain capabilities that could be used to serve God. At the same time, I began to question whether this assurance in myself meant that I was proud. Well aware of the fact that pride leads to destruction, I began to wonder whether my newfound confidence might instead be cleverly concealed pride. To find out, I decided to try my best to âact humble.â Unfortunately, it turns out that I had a misconception about humility as well. Not known as an outwardly shy person and at times probably considered to be quite the opposite, I began to force myself to become quieter. I knew that on occasion, well-intentioned youths could be a bit too headstrong in that their fervency to serve God causes them to become easily frustrated with what they perceive as the inefficient efforts of older members. Therefore, I wanted to try extra hard to please and submit to other church workers. I remember leading one Sabbath Bible study in particular and was so caught up in worrying about coming across as a pretentious youth that I wound up sounding completely unsure of myself. Very few people were edified during that session, and I realized that I couldnât expect others to be assured of what I was saying if it didnât seem like I was completely convinced, either. Counting on God I soon realized that no matter what, I could not please everybody. What really matters is pleasing God first and foremost. The apostle Paul possessed a similar attitude: âI myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and menâ (Acts 24:16). While we must try our best to get along with others, we must not lose sight of the fact that pleasing God is more important than pleasing man. Paul, too, recognized that we must make every effort to not offend others, but note how he clearly placed having a clear conscience in front of God before having a clear conscience in front of men. My failed attempts to appear humble only resulted in me finding myself right back where I had startedâfilled with self-doubt and still somewhat confused. While meekness and knowing when and what not to speak are invaluable qualities, outward quietness does not necessarily mean that one is more spiritual or humble. After all, it is quite possible to have an outward appearance of modesty while still feeling rather self-righteous inwardly. Through these trial-and-error processes, Iâve come to learn that self-doubt does not and should not be equated with humility. What then, is the difference? Self-doubt can cause one to place too much emphasis on our own human efforts, or lack thereof, while true humility makes one recognize that, in strength and in weakness, we must always count on God. Putting God First So then what about that other question of whether or not self-confidence equals pride? Again, the key to that answer lies in where we place God in all of this. We can and need to have an awareness of our own abilities. If we didnât recognize our own talents, how would we know how we could best serve God? However, it is essential to recognize that God gives those talents to us for a special purposeâto glorify Him and not ourselves. To prevent that ever-present threat of pride from sneaking in, we need to simultaneously have confidence in God to help us use our abilities wisely. As 1 Cor 4:7 reminds us, âFor who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you have not received it?â As we become entrusted with church work, it is only natural to want to do the best job possible. But we must constantly ask ourselves whether this need arises from a desire to protect or boost our own reputation, or whether we seek solely to exalt Godâs name. While I have made some embarrassing mistakes since learning these lessons, I tell myself to look forward to the ones I will surely make in the future, for mistakes are channels through which I can learn how to better serve my Lord."
1,524,Is Speaking in Tongues the Necessary Evidence of Receiving the Holy Spirit?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1741-pub.html,"Is Speaking in Tongues the Necessary Evidence of Receiving the Holy Spirit? Examining Prevalent Views The Apostolic Experience The Disciples on the Day of Pentecost The Believers in Samaria Cornelius The Believers in Ephesus Do All Speak with Tongues? (1 Corinthians 12) The Meaning and Purpose of Spiritual Gifts Preaching vs. Praying in Tongues What Shall I Do? Examining Prevalent Views When does a person receive the Holy Spirit? The common answer, ""upon accepting Jesus Christ,"" is based on the following rationale: A person is saved immediately upon accepting Jesus Christ. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is an integral part of God's saving grace. Therefore, a person receives the Holy Spirit as soon as he or she accepts Jesus Christ. Based on this view, many cannot accept that speaking in tongues is the necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. The fact that many Christians today are unable to speak in tongues seems to negate the possibility that speaking in tongues is the evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. If these Christians are saved, can we say that they have not received the Holy Spirit? The reasoning follows: Most Christians cannot speak in tongues. Every Christian has the Holy Spirit. Therefore, speaking in tongues is not the necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. A similar argument reasons: Many Christians practice good deeds and bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit. These Christians have the Holy Spirit but do not necessarily speak in tongues Therefore, not everyone who has the Holy Spirit speak in tongues. Although the necessity of tongues may seem to be totally unacceptable according to the above rationales, we need to first examine their premises to see whether they stand according to the truth of the Bible. The Bible does teach that the promise of the Holy Spirit is for all believers (Jn 7:37-39; Acts 2:38-39). But it never teaches that the Holy Spirit dwells in believers the very moment they accept Jesus Christ into their hearts. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is an integral part of God's saving grace, but it does not necessarily follow that this indwelling has to happen at the moment of accepting Jesus Christ. In fact, the accounts in Acts indicate that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a separate event that usually takes place after a person's acceptance of Christ and baptism. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is also contingent on whether a person accepts the complete gospel of salvation. While the good deeds of a professed Christian are due to the inspiration and movement of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 12:3), we can see from the Bible that the believers in the early church did not use good deeds to determine whether a person has been baptized by the Holy Spirit. People may be moved by the Spirit to accept Christ or perform good deeds, but that does not necessarily mean that they have already received the indwelling Holy Spirit. We also cannot use numbers as our guide. Although many professed Christians today do not speak in tongues, this fact cannot rule out speaking in tongues as the necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. To find the truth, we need to go back to the Scriptures rather than judge by numbers. Is it biblical to say that speaking in tongues is the necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit? Does everyone who receives the Holy Spirit speak in tongues? To answer these questions, let us look at the apostolic experience and ask, ""How did the apostles know whether a person had received the Holy Spirit?"" Examining the accounts in Acts, we will easily see that receiving the Holy Spirit was not simply a silent, inward occurrence. Rather, it involved an obvious, external signâthe speaking of tongues. The Apostolic Experience (See also the section titled ""The Apostolic Precedent"" in the ""One Spirit"" article ) The Disciples on the Day of Pentecost Before His ascension, the Lord Jesus promised the disciples that they would be baptized with the Holy Spirit in a few days (Acts 1:5). So the disciples waited in the upper room in Jerusalem with prayer and supplication (Acts 1:12-14). Obviously, the coming of the Holy Spirit had to be accompanied by some evidence. If not, the disciples would not have had no way of knowing when the Holy Spirit had actually come. On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came. There came a sound from heaven, and divided tongues, as of fire, rested on each one of the disciples. Then they all began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance (Acts 2:1-4). Because of the powerful experience, which everyone could see and hear (Acts 2:33), the disciples knew that they had received the Holy Spirit. Many people argue that the external evidence of speaking in tongues was necessary in this case because this was the first time in history that the Holy Spirit was poured out. According to their view, such evidence would no longer be necessary because the Holy Spirit, once poured out, would be with the church forever. Anyone who believed in Christ thereafter would automatically have the Holy Spirit in them. Let us look at the subsequent accounts in Acts of people receiving the Holy Spirit to see whether the above argument stands. The Believers in Samaria In Acts chapter 8, we read that the multitude in Samaria believed in the Lord and was baptized. But their acceptance of Jesus Christ and their baptism were not the evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. Luke, the writer of Acts, tells us that the apostles in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to Samaria because they learned that the Holy Spirit had not fallen on any of them (Acts 8:14-16). This account immediately calls into question the argument that the believers since the Pentecost received the Holy Spirit automatically without any external evidence. If this argument were true, Luke as well as the apostles in Jerusalem must have been mistaken. But what made the apostles conclude that these believers had not received the Holy Spirit? Some necessary evidence must have been missing to lead them to that conclusion. Peter and John came down to Samaria to pray for the believers that they might receive the Holy Spirit. When the apostles laid hands on them, they received the Holy Spirit. Although Acts does not describe the experience in detail, some visible evidence must have accompanied the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, for Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands (Acts 8:17-18). We may not be able to argue that, based on this passage, speaking in tongues was the evidence in this case, but at the very least we know that some kind of visible sign was the necessary evidence that allowed everyone to see that the Holy Spirit had come to these believers. Cornelius Acts chapter 10 tells us that the Holy Spirit fell upon Cornelius and all the others who heard Peter preaching: And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. (Acts 10:45-46) How did the circumcised brothers who were with Peter know that the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles? The passage states very plainly: they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Since it was obvious that God had also chosen these gentile believers, Peter said, ""Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"" (v. 47). Notice that Peter and his companions were able to discern the pouring out of the Holy Spirit because the experience was identical to the disciples' own experience on Pentecost , when the Holy Spirit enabled them to speak in tongues (see also Acts 11:15). Peter used speaking in tongues as the criterion to determine that Cornelius and the others had received the Holy Spirit. This was the way the apostles discerned the coming of the Holy Spirit upon a believer. We ought to use the same approach today to determine whether we have received the Holy Spirit. The Believers in Ephesus Acts 19 records that Paul came to Ephesus and found some disciples. He said to them, ""Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"" The disciples replied that they had not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit. So Paul asked them what baptism they had received and found out that they had only been baptized into John's baptism. Then Paul preached to them about Jesus Christ and baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus. Let us analyze this situation carefully. Why did Paul have to ask these disciples whether they had received the Holy Spirit if he supposedly believed the Holy Spirit is given the moment a person believes? Wouldn't this question be redundant? He should have corrected them and said, ""You already have the Holy Spirit in you, but you just didn't realize it."" But suppose that these were disciples of John but not disciples of Jesus Christ, meaning that they had not yet believed in Jesus Christ. Suppose Paul asked them whether they had received the Holy Spirit in order to test whether they believed in Jesus Christ. As it turned out, these believers had not been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So they decided to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When they made the decision to accept Jesus Christ and be baptized, Paul had already accomplished the intended purpose behind his question. At this point, he could have said, ""now that you have accepted Jesus Christ, you have also received the Holy Spirit."" But Paul did not say that. Did these believers receive the Holy Spirit at that very moment? The answer is ""no."" In fact, even as they were baptized, they still did not have the Holy Spirit. Verse 6 reads, ""And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied."" The Holy Spirit came upon them not when they decided to be baptized into Christ nor during their baptism into Christ, but when they spoke with tongues and prophesied after baptism. Notice that Luke records specifically that the Holy Spirit came upon them when Paul had laid hands on them. How did Luke know that the Holy Spirit came upon them at that very moment? The answer is that they spoke with tongues and prophesied. If the Holy Spirit were given at the moment of accepting Jesus Christ, and speaking in tongues were not the necessary evidence, Luke would not have even needed to record that the Holy Spirit came on them subsequently. In fact, it would have been wrong for Luke to say that the Holy Spirit came on them when Paul laid hands on them and associate the coming of the Holy Spirit with the speaking of tongues. But as the passage clearly demonstrates, speaking in tongues is the evidence that accompanies receiving the Holy Spirit. Indeed, these examples in Acts prove that speaking in tongues is the necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. Do All Speak with Tongues? ""There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues."" (1 Cor 12:4-10) ""And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?"" (1 Cor 12:28-30) Chapter 12 of 1 Corinthians has often been cited to support the view that speaking in tongues is not a necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. According to these passages, different individuals in the church have different gifts. Speaking with tongues is listed as one of the gifts. This implies that not everyone in the church has the ability to speak with tongues. The answer to the rhetorical question, ""Do all speak with tongues?"" is obvious: No, not all speak with tongues. If not all speak with tongues, one may argue, than how can tongues be the necessary evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit? The Meaning and Purpose of Spiritual Gifts If we look carefully at the list of gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, we see that ""faith"" is among the spiritual gifts (v. 9). The Spirit gives the gift of faith to some, but not to others. Does this mean that faith is not necessary for all Christians? Few would argue that, based on this verse, faith is not necessary for all believers. But why does Paul list faith as a spiritual gift, something that not every believer has? The answer lies in what kind of faith Paul is speaking of in this context. It is important to note that the purpose of the diverse spiritual gifts is to build up the body of Christ. As Paul stated, ""The manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all"" (v. 7). This means that the gift of faith is given to some for the purpose of edifying the church. Believers who are given this unique gift are able to demonstrate an unusually strong faith. Such faith is different from the faith in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation, a faith that all believers ought to have. Whereas the faith that is required for salvation is a faith that benefits the individual, the spiritual gift of faith builds up other believers in the church. They serve two distinctly differently purposes Having seen the distinction between the two kinds of faith, we now return to the subject of speaking in tongues. Preaching vs. Praying in Tongues Just as the faith referred to in 1 Corinthians 12 is different from the faith required of all believers, the gift of speaking in tongues is different from the speaking in tongues that is a sign of receiving the Holy Spirit. The speaking of tongues referred to in 1 Corinthians 12 is preaching in tongues . Paul calls this gift ""different kinds of tongues"" (v. 10). It is for the purpose of building up the church . This is a gift that not every believer has, for it is distributed by the Spirit according to His will. Since this gift is for the benefit of other believers, it must be interpreted into a human language. That is why Paul commanded the Corinthian church not to preach in tongues unless the tongues are interpreted for the edification of the church (1 Cor 14:5, 27-28). For the same reason, the gift of tongues mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 is always accompanied by the gift of interpretation of tongues (vv. 10, 30). Without interpretation, preaching in tongues fails its intended purpose. On the other hand, the speaking in tongues that accompanies the indwelling of the Holy Spirit serves quite a different purpose; it is associated with prayer and praise (Acts 2:11, 10:45-46). For this reason, we may call it "" prayer in tongues ."" When a person prays in a tongue, he is speaking to God, not to men (1 Cor 14:2, 28). Its purpose is to edify the individual rather than the church (v. 4), as Paul explained in Romans 8: Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. (Rom 8:26-27) During prayer, the Holy Spirit enables the believer to pray in tongues, which are ""groanings which cannot be uttered."" The Holy Spirit intercedes for the believer through a spiritual language for the believer's edification. When spoken in prayer, tongues need not be interpreted because they are directed to God, not to men. Based on Paul's letter to the Corinthians, we see that they had confused the two kinds of speaking of tongues. Many who did not have the special gift of preaching in tongues presumed to have the gift, perhaps motivated by the desire to compete with one another. They misused the tongues in prayer to preach to the congregation. Without the ability to interpret what they were saying, and without following the guidance of the Holy Spirit, these believers caused confusion and disorder in the church. In order to end this chaos, Paul had to warn them not to preach in tongues unless someone could interpret the tongues. He drew a distinction between preaching and praying in tongues. He instructed them that if there was no one to interpret the tongues, they ought only to pray in tongues instead of using tongues for preaching. Once we understand the distinction between preaching and prayer in tongues, we can also avoid misinterpreting Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 12. When he asked, ""Do all speak with tongues?"", he was referring to preaching in tongues for the edification of the church, not praying in tongues for the edification of the individual. What Shall I Do? The aim of this study is not to debate over some finer points of theology. Rather, it addresses a crucial and larger issue that confronts many Christians today. We urge all sincere Christians to look at the apostolic experience and see if they have also experienced the Holy Spirit in the same way. If you have never experienced speaking in tongues, this means that you have not yet received the Holy Spirit. If you are in a congregation where most or all the members do not have this experience, it means that the Holy Spirit is not present in your church. It is time to take action to find out how to receive the precious promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of your heavenly inheritance.

1,585,A Mother's Place: At Home or At Work?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1802-pub.html,"A Mother's Place: At Home or At Work? ""To work or not to work?"" This has been a constant debate in my mind recently, as another ""bundle of joy"" soon arrives. My husband and I are excited to hold that tiny, wrinkly, cuddly baby, to smell its milky scent, and to admire another wonderful creation of God. At the same time, we are not sure if we are ready to handle the added financial responsibilities that come with this new life. In addition, I sometimes ask myself, ""Did I go to school all those years just to be buried in endless dishes, dirty laundry, diapers, and other household chores?"" Up until now, I thought I was sure that I had made the right choice in becoming a stay-at-home mom. I have read research suggesting that children who have close bonds with their stay-at-home mothers (or fathers in rare cases) tend to grow up to become more well-adjusted adults. I have witnessed how young children whose mothers stay at home tend to be more obedient than children who go to daycare. I myself have also reaped the fruits of joy and pride that come from staying home with my firstborn. Yet something nudges inside me once in a while, particularly when I hear how ""successful"" some of my former college friends are, making me question, ""Is this what life is all about?"" They have respectable professions and seemingly happy families. Why do I sometimes feel embarrassed instead of being proud when I confess that I am a stay-at-home mom? Thus begins my quest to decide whether ""to work or not to work."" In my search for an answer, I came across questions such as: Do other mothers struggle like me? What does the Bible say about a mother's role in the family? And how can I live my life in a way that will glorify God the most? Why Stay At Home? The Bible does not really tell us specifically what is best for mothers. However, the Bible does tell us what is important to children: ""Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it"" (Prov 22:6). God also instructs parents to teach their children the words of God in their daily lives (Deut 6:5-9). So, how can a family best accomplish the above two requirements? The best alternative is for mothers to stay home with their young children to instill the teachings from the Bible. Of course, mothers who work away from home can also find time to teach biblical values to their children. Nevertheless, we must admit that it is most likely easier for stay-at-home moms to spend more time with their children in anything than mothers who work away from home. Recently, I stumbled across a book entitled Mother in the Middle. To my surprise, two Christian authors, Deborah Lewis and Charmaine Yoest, describe how all the women they interviewed struggled with the same dilemma I am facing right now. They called the book Mother in the Middle because so many mothers are caught in the midst of a dilemma: the desire to spend more time with their children and the need to work away from home. Many working mothers feel guilty every time they leave their children to go to work, and they never seem to feel content with themselves even though they are doing the best they can to support and care for their families. The authors also describe the complete transformation of some ""career-minded"" women, once they realized what motherhood meant to them. These women were willing to give up the professional positions that they had worked so hard to attain, and to make drastic cutbacks or changes in their lifestyle in order to spend more time with their children. Not surprisingly, the mothers who made a conscious decision to stay home with their children, despite the ""sacrifices"" they made, were the happiest of all the groups of mothers that the authors interviewed. It is absolutely essential that we mothers have a clear understanding of motherhood. The most satisfied mothers that Lewis and Yoest interviewed were those who considered their work as mothers to be their ""greatest work"" and ""the most important thing"" they will ever do. One mother said, ""I consider putting loving, caring, responsible adults into our world to be a greater accomplishment than anything I could ever do as a high-powered executive of a major company."" This sense of mission motivated them to build their support systems, to rearrange their priorities, to find creative solutions to financial problems, and to focus on the joys of children. 1 The Contributing Mother Becoming a stay-at-home mom does not mean that you are no longer free to do anything else that is productive. If we look at the Bibleâs description of the ideal wife in Proverbs 31:10-31, we can see that while she took care of the family, at the same time she managed to help with the family finances and contributed to society. She knew how to work with wool and flax. She provided food for her family and her servants. She bought land. She planted a vineyard. She traded successfully. She could weave and make garments and bedding both for her family and for profit. She oversaw the affairs of her household. She helped the poor and needy. Her husband and children held her in high regard, and she was praised as a woman surpassing many others who did noble things (Prov 31:29). What does this mean to us today? It means that while our first priority should be to raise godly children, we can contribute to our family and society in other ways as well. Understanding that each of us is in a unique situation, I would like to share some workable possibilities that I have discovered in the course of my research, which might be helpful for other mothers too. In their book, Lewis and Yoest have gathered some strategies that those ""mothers in the middle"" have used, and I find them to be very helpful references. Taking One Thing At a Time The philosophy behind this strategy is that you can have it allâjust not all at once. Consider that both Sandra Day OâConnor, U.S. Supreme Court justice, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, stayed home when their children were small. 2 Childrenâs advocates tell us that the first five years of a childâs life can greatly impact the rest of his or her adult life. Therefore, many women choose to put their careers on hold until their young children reach school age. Volunteer Work Just because youâre a ""stay-at-home mom"" doesnât mean that you canât also be a contributing member of your community. Many organizations, especially nonprofit ones, rely heavily on mother-volunteers. They help out with schools, churches, food banks, homeless shelters, teen pregnancy programs, etc. Although volunteer work does not pay, it is real and valuable work that enriches the lives of all those involved. Continuing Education Some mothers enrich their lives by learning or studying while at home with children. Some take night classes; others attend seminars and workshops in order to pursue a long-time interest. Now, with the help of technology, it is possible to take classes at home via the television or the Internet. Home-based Business For several of the mothers that Lewis and Yoest talked with, motherhood was the turning point that forced them to do something creative, steering them into new entrepreneurial careers. Some mothers ran home-based daycare centers. One mother ran a mail-order catalog business out of her basement; another designed and marketed greeting cards; another was a published writer; one mother sold Amway products; and one had a home-decorating business. Some former teachers tutored students on weekends and evenings. And there are many other opportunities for those interested in working at home. The Part-time Solution Some mothers found part-time work to be the optimal solution because they could stay at home with their children and still keep their profession part-time. However, not every workplace can accommodate part-time work, so it is sometimes necessary for mothers to change their careers in order to work at a job that allows them more flexibility. Tag-team Match In one family, the husband and wife worked at different shifts of the day so that one of them would always be home for their children. This couple seemed to enjoy the arrangement, but it is not a very common one, because not many people enjoy working night shifts. Finding a Support Group A great majority of the most contented mothers made connections with other moms on a regular basis. Some found support through their churches, others through La Leche League, and others through mother-oriented groups like MOPS and MotherCare. Husband Support It is impossible for women to be successful mothers without the support of their closest partners, their husbands. Just as in a healthy marriage both partners must strive for a common goal, so it is in successful parenting. Both parents must recognize the importance of raising well-adjusted children and be willing to make the sacrifices and adjustments that make it all possible. Indeed, all of the most contented mothers that Lewis and Yoest interviewed said that the most important thing contributing to their happy motherhood was the strong support of their husbands. Leah Lampone, former Milwaukee County circuit judge, left the bench after fourteen years to come home and care for her children. She said, ""Looking back upon my years as both judge and mother, I have come to realize the greatest impact I have made in any life is that which Iâve made in the lives of my children."" 3 Finally, what does all of this mean to me? I learned that there are many mothers who feel as confused and frustrated as I do; who feel the pressure from societyâs expectations and from their familyâs financial needs. I learned that the Bible values the role of mothers as important contributing members of the family. And I also learned that there are actually many options that allow me to be an involved mother and a fulfilled individual at the same time. Looking at my toddler daughter proudly displaying her drawing of a happy face, I am amazed at how quickly she has grown. Soon she will be going to school, going to college, and eventually having her own family. I realize that life is short. ""But childhood is shorter. And motherhood is the one road, if not taken, to which we can never return."" 4 Deborah S. Lewis and Charmaine C. Yoest, Mother in the Middle (Michigan: Zondervan, 1996), p. 219.

1,615,Who Can Enter the Kingdom of God?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1832-pub.html,"Who Can Enter the Kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is not an earthly kingdom. It exists in a spiritual dimension that we cannot detect with our physical senses. It is the realm where God reigns, which He prepared for us even before the creation of the world. For every believer, the kingdom of God is the ultimate goal. We all know that to enter God's kingdom, we must be ""born of water and the spirit"" (Jn 3:5) and obey the Father's will (Mt 7:21). But as Jesus makes clear, we also must have the right attitude in our daily lives. What attitude do we need to enter the kingdom of God? Jesus Contrasts the Attitude of Children and of the Pharisees 1) To Enter God's Kingdom, You Should Be Like a Child Children are eager. All four Gospels bear the account of people bringing their young ones before the Lord Jesus so that He might touch them. When His disciples tried to stop them, Jesus said, ""Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it"" (Lk 18:15-17). Children are humble. At another time the disciples asked Jesus, ""Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"" Jesus answered, ""Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven"" (Mt 18:1-4). 2) The Pharisees Won't Enter God's Kingdom The Pharisees are arrogant. Jesus tells a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector praying in the temple: ""The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank You that I am not like other men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess'"" (Lk 18:11-12). They also loved to pray standing in the synagogues and on street corners. Their real intention was not to pray to God, but rather to be seen by men, to receive their praises. The scribes and Pharisees were not ignorant of righteous deeds; they were taught from the Books of the Law and they placed special emphasis on displaying their ardent devotion in observing the Law. But Jesus condemns their motivations: ""all their works they do to be seen by men."" (Mt 23:5). The Pharisees desire the glory of men on earth; and Jesus says that such earthly glory will be their only reward (Matt 6:2, 5). They will not receive the reward of God? The Pharisees are hypocrites. Jesus taught His disciples, ""For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven"" (Mt 5:20). The Scribes and Pharisees were adept at putting up pretences. For instance, although on the surface they seemed to regard Sabbath keeping highly, they actually did not understand the true significance of keeping the Sabbath. Therefore, the Lord Jesus rebuked them, calling them hypocrites and whitewashed tombs, which are beautiful on the outside but are full of dead man's bones (Mt 23:27-28). In whatever we do, our actions must be in accordance with our intentions. The Lord Jesus said, ""First cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside may be clean also"" (Mt 23:26). This is to teach us that we must first adorn our inner self, before a good image of truth without hypocrisy will naturally appear. Not Everyone Will Enter the Kingdom The Lord Jesus once said, ""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord' shall enter the kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of my Father in heaven. On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!"" (Mt 7:21-23). The Lord Jesus will surely come one day. At that time, there will be many who are left outside the gates of Heaven, weeping and gnashing their teeth. Jesus clearly tells us what type of person will enter His kingdom. We must each decide how we will follow His teachings-like a child or like a Pharisee."
1,634,Is Your Faith Your Own?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1851-pub.html,"Is Your Faith Your Own? Moving away from home to go to college was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. While three thousand miles separated me physically from my family and familiar surroundings, I felt as if a galaxy stood between my spiritual foundation and my personal faith in and relationship with God. Of course, I didnât realize this at first. Until I moved away, my faith had been rooted in my family, my brothers and sisters in the True Jesus Church, and the cultural and social ritual of going to church. Enjoying Newfound Freedom So I left the comforts of home to explore college, make new friends, attend classes, and enjoy the luxuries of a liberal arts education. I have to admit that I didnât really think about what was going to happen to my faith. It hadnât occurred to me that anything would fundamentally change or that I should be concerned about my spiritual identity. I wish I could say that I searched immediately for friends who also shared faith, or that I prayed and studied the Bible on my own to cultivate a relationship with God. In truth, I was so focused on my education and all the new stimuli around me that I hardly thought about God, salvation, fellowship, prayer, and so on. No one around me had expectations for me to attend church every weekend or ""be Christian."" Unfortunately, without the external pressure and my own internal fire for God, my faith hit a standstill. In fact, I found excitement and new challenges in this newfound independence. I remember late-night conversations with hall-mates about political beliefs or socioeconomic injustices in the world. I studied the politics of war, macroeconomics, psychology, and literature. All these things I found edifying, but in an academic senseâeven casual debates about religion and the validity and deconstruction of the Bible. Like many college kids, I attended parties, hung out with peers, ate pizza, ice cream, and lots of mashed potatoes, and attended football and basketball games. Unaware that my spiritual health needed to be nurtured, I let down God by letting my faith fall behind. Fanning the Flame of Faith Toward the end of my freshman year, I found success in academics and in an outgoing group of friends. I was, by and large, a well-adjusted college student. Yet a distant, dull emptiness and sadness existed in my heart. I felt unsettled that maybe my self-selected friends didnât really know who I was. Sure, they knew I was a Chinese-American woman from Southern California interested in democracy and political science, a feminist and a former cheerleader. But did they know that my spiritual faith (admittedly a weak one) existed and had informed my values and beliefs for as far back as I could remember? And yet, how could they? Furthermore, why had I failed to communicate to others either through actions or words that this faith existed? By some grace of God, or maybe even as a result of that tiny flame of faith built up by family and a lifetime ritual of going to church, I met a friend, Ruth, at the end of my freshman year. We shared questions about religion and faith, and for the very first time in my life someone challenged me to explain my beliefs. Why did I go to church on Saturday (at least theoretically, since I wasnât regularly attending the Philadelphia prayer house services)? How did I understand the path to salvation to be constructed? Is the Holy Spirit truly present only when spiritual tongues are spoken? To my embarrassment, I didnât have ready answers to these questions. But finally I began exploring the beliefs I had held and practiced for almost two decades. The most poignant thing about this time in my life was that I needed to figure outâon my own terms and through my own actionsâwhy I believed in God. Did He truly love me? Was I really a part of His flock? If so, what did this mean for meâthis idealistic college student, far away from home? And, most important, what choices would I make about how I lived my life? Finding GodâAgain Over the next year, I found God again. I wouldnât say that I ever wholly lost Him, but more that I found him on my own. There wasnât a dramatic moment of clarity when, through lightning and thunder, God spoke to me. No bells and whistles or fanfare about it. Rather, finding my faith and experiencing Godâs love came over time, through a process in which I continued to seek him out. Through a combination of studying the Bible, singing praises through an a cappella Christian group, praying, and seeking friends with whom I could be challenged in faith, my spiritual foundation built up. I remember one conversation when a friend asked if I believed that God loved me and that He promised His salvation for me. I just knew. I canât accurately describe why, or how it felt, but my heart was sure of Godâs love for me. Itâs weird how life plays out. During that time in college, I didnât actively have to pursue a faith; I could have walked away. How terribly scary and powerful is that? Yet, I found Him. Looking back, I canât recall how those conversations with Ruth began or how I even met her. I found mercy in Godâs eyes and He drew me near. I believe that God kept me in His fold because I hadnât totally closed him outâsomehow my heart still wanted to know what faith meant to me. God doesnât fail us if we have a heart to seek Him. And so I share this story not because Iâm proud of my particular path of faith, but simply to convey that God is so patient and so kind, and He is constantly with usâeven when we feel the farthest away. Do You Know Whom You Believe? Independence and freedom come with choice and free willâtremendous responsibilities for an eighteen-year-old. From the mundane decisions in life (Do I feel like going to class today?) to the more weighty ones (Should I go to this party and drink?), all of a sudden I had complete say in what I chose to do and who I chose to be. So if you are enjoying your newfound independence and still wondering how faith fits into your life, donât forget to ask questions and find out for yourself. You alone are responsible for your own path. And a relationship with God is truly the most personal relationship you can have. Leaving the safe harbor of home and family can be both strangely terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. Now Iâm a student again, this time in graduate school, also some three thousand miles from home. I face similar challenges to those of my college days, such as meeting a new set of friends and adjusting to a new environment. This time around, however, my foundation of faith is my own. So as I ride this roller coaster of my life, where there are so many opportunities to redefine who I want to be, how does my faith in God play out in day-to-day priorities and practical living? Itâs a constant struggle to draw closer to God and keep an active faith. I would be lying if I said that it wasnât. But Iâve experienced the love of Christ for myself, and I know whom I believe in. Do you? If not, do you have the heart to seek answers?

1,638,A Multiethnic Church: Is It Really Possible?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1855-pub.html,"A Multiethnic Church: Is It Really Possible? Jesus Christ gave His disciples two great commissions before ascending into heaven: to care for His church and to preach the gospel to all nations (Mt 28:19; Lk 24:47). This was a command to the first Christians, and similarly it is a command to us today. Because it is a command, we have assurance that we can succeed in this mission. The unity of cultures corresponds to the Lordâs will (Gal 3:28; Col 3:11; Isa 11:6-9) and should not pose an obstacle for the church today. Harmony between members despite differences of culture shows that we are united by the power of the Holy Spirit, the one faith, and the will of God. We should try our best to carry out this mission so that all peoples can see our union of love, peace, and joy. Addressing Multicultural Issues Many problems arose when the church in Jerusalem, which comprised primarily Jewish members, began to include Gentiles. There were theological problems (i.e., should Gentiles be circumcised?), cultural differences (i.e., should women be veiled?), and no doubt communication issues (i.e., which language should sermons be delivered in or translated into?). Today, some people think that the solution to multicultural issues in the church is to separate the cultures, but that would be a serious mistake. First, this is not the example set by the apostolic church. Second, the multiethnic church is proof that unity comes from our faith and from the Holy Spirit. If other churches fail, we the True Jesus Church can succeed because we are the only church united by the one true faith and the Holy Spirit. Although it is the will of God for all nations to be unified in His church, the task is not necessarily an easy one. It requires a good understanding of Godâs will and a lot of effort from the believers. The Apostolic Church and the True Jesus Church When the Holy Spirit first descended on the Jewish believers in Jerusalem during the apostolic period, they began spreading the good news. Their mission was to preach the message of salvation to all corners of the earthâwhich in their minds stopped at Spain! Members of the early church in Jerusalem were in no hurry to preach the gospel âin all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.â They were too busy managing the daily growth of the church. The believers were rejoicing under the blessing of the Lord and led abundant Christian lives full of sincerity, joy, and harmony. It was only when persecution arose that the church started to expand. In the same way, the Holy Spirit descended at the beginning of this century as the latter rain, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. Jesus Christ has chosen the True Jesus Church, which originated from China, to spread the true and complete plan of salvation to all nations.1 Like the early church, the True Jesus Church is heavily involved in caring for local churches. The majority of preachers spend their time and energy pastoring members rather than spreading the Word. Like the early Jewish Christians who preached to their fellow Jews, the majority of the Chinese members preach to other Chinese simply because it is easier and more natural. Hope of the New Generation Despite this situation, the gospel has begun to spread to all continents due to immigration and occasionally to missionary work. Unfortunately, though, most of the churches comprised of Asian immigrants have been unable to âopen upâ to all culturesâparticularly to the local population. Generally, the True Jesus Church has spread to different countries without really integrating with the local people or accepting the local customs. It is therefore difficult for the only church of God, chosen by His Spirit, to accomplish the plan of salvation for all nations. Today, we are at the beginning of a new phase. The second-generation immigrants have integrated with the local culture and speak the native language. Perhaps God will work with the second-generation immigrants to bring new believers from all nations into the church. Further-more, overseas missionary training programs are now in progress to complete the mission that the Lord has entrusted to us. Most churches established by immigrants face similar problemsâ they are involved in pioneer work without the benefit of prior experience that other local churches enjoy. But due to Godâs grace and membersâ efforts, the church has successfully begun to open up to non-Asians, thereby concretely carrying out Godâs mission. The Paris Church An Example of a Multiethnic Church Today The True Jesus Church in Paris is one of the churches whose multiethnic congregation enjoys unity through our faith and through the Holy Spirit. The Paris church has a congregation of about sixty members who attend services regularly. These believers are from Cambodia, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Laos, Reunion Island, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Though the majority are Asians, they neither speak the same language nor share the same culture. About 20% of the Paris members are Caucasianâthe highest percentage of any local True Jesus Church. By the grace of the Lord, none of the native French members have left the church. Background of France France is traditionally a Catholic country. However, the majority of the French do not read the Bible and do not believe that it is the Word of the living God. Generally, people go to church for baptisms, marriages, and funerals; some attend midnight mass on December 24th. In French history, the church was responsible for much bloodshed. Unable to overlook the past, most French reject Christianity and consequently reject Jesus. French philosophers like Descartes spread the humanistic view that people are intelligent enough to detect Godâs presence; and since they cannot prove it, therefore God does not exist. This concept led most French to become atheists. There are also some French who, having been disappointed by Christianity and rationalism, have turned to Buddhism. These confused circumstances make it difficult for the True Jesus Church to preach the gospel in France, but if we keep our eyes on our almighty God, we need not be discouraged. A Church for All People When the Paris church was first established, members were conscious of the difficulties of preaching in the western hemisphere and were prepared to integrate. They wanted others to know that this is the Church of Godânot a âChinese church.â Some of our church buildings in western countries display the name âTrue Jesus Churchâ only in Chinese. This reinforces the popular notion that the Chinese tend to congregate and to re-create their native environment wherever they go. The non-Asians who pass by take no notice at all because they think it is a Chinese churchânot a place where they belong. Although in Paris the majority of the members are Chinese, the name of the church is displayed in French. This shows nonmembers that this is a church for all people, not just for the Chinese community. Bridging the Gap When you come to the Paris church, you often feel touched by the love and kindness of the members who approach you with slightly broken French, trying their best to make you feel at ease. You also hear everybody singing hymns in French, except on rare occasions when there are visitors from abroad. Realizing that it is hard for people to be touched by hymns in a foreign language, the Paris church worked hard to produce a French hymnbook. The members learned to sing in French in order to evangelize to the native population. The Chinese members put aside their Chinese hymnbooks to sing in a language they barely understood, practicing each hymn and learning the meaning of the words. For the native French members, this was a tremendous blessing. It showed the membersâ spiritual growth and their love for those who have not heard the Truth. These acts, which reach out to people of other cultures, are a kind of holy work that should not be overlooked. Today, the Asian members have improved their French through sermon translations (from Mandarin to French) and by communicating with the native French believers. Celebration of Brotherly Love Last year, the Paris church made further progress by holding the annual New Yearâs meal on the French New Year rather than the Chinese (lunar) New Year. During this celebration, one Chinese mother cooked a French dish for the members who preferred French cuisine, and a French mother cooked a Chinese dish for her Asian brothers and sisters! The food is not the issue here; it is that these acts of thoughtfulness show brotherly love and kindness. Through the grace of God, this is the spirit of the Paris church today. We still have a long way to go, but for the majority of the Paris members, there is no such thing as âChineseâ or âFrench,â because we are all one in Christ Jesus! Unity â Everyone's Responsibility In the True Jesus Church it is possible for all cultures to come together in Jesus, and this quality shows the world that we are the only church of the last days. But this is only possible through the power of the Holy Spirit, which is manifested by a concrete willingness to love God and to love men. Paul said that he was free from all men, but he became a servant to all so that he would not be an obstacle for the spread of the gospel. He became all things to all men so that he might by all means save some (1 Cor 9:19ff). Of course, Paul did so within the bounds of the gospel. Paulâs attitude reminds us to try our utmost to become a Kenyan in Kenya, a Canadian in Canada, a German in Germany, and a Cambodian in Cambodiaâout of love, out of duty, and to have a part in the blessing of the gospel (1 Cor 9:23). The Paris church still needs to improve in many areas, and it should not be seen as the ideal church. Through its example, however, we can see that cultural unity requires everyoneâs effort. Although it is the will and command of God, there are many things we must do to achieve it. May God help us as we encourage one another to accomplish His will and to preach to all nations. Amen! 1 During the apostolic times in the âwinterâ after the âfall rain,â heresies began to invade the church and the gospel of salvation became corrupted (Deut 11:14; Jer 5:24; Joel 2:23; Zech 10:1; Jas 5:7). According to Scripture, God would establish a second church during the âspring rain,â before His coming in the summer. This last and glorious church would come from the East (Ezek 43:2; Mt 24:27; Rev 7:2)."
1,649,Are You Ready to Die?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1866-pub.html,"Are You Ready to Die? ...and he died instantly... These unforgettable words came over the phone one day last summer. A friend of mine was killed in a terrible accident. The question ""Why?"" was the first thing that came to mind after the initial shock wore off. He was only twenty something, he was my brother in Christ and my friend. He was full of life and energy. Recently graduated from university, he had just begun a new chapter in life, which he had barely just tasted. He had so many plans. Little did he know that he was going to die so soon. None of us expected it too. Through faith, I understand and accept that God grants us life and thus has the full right and authority to take it away. Nonetheless, I still found the shocking news difficult to accept and comprehend and the same question ""Why?"" continued to linger in my mind. I should and do, however, take great comfort in the fact that he is enjoying a new chapter in his life now ?and a far more joyful, meaningful and tranquil life than one could ever imagine. Praise the Lord! ""Man's life is short."" How many times have we heard that? These words only took effect on me when my friend's life ended so suddenly. Life is like the sound of a bell, whose resonance reaches its listeners for a moment and is heard no more. Despite the gradual increase in health awareness and the advancement of medical knowledge and technology, none can live forever. The law of nature determines that where there is life, there will also be death. Death is a certainty that no one can prevent from happening, although the actual time it happens is uncertain. Furthermore, death knows no barriers and is not prejudicial ?it does not just visit the old and the sick as is the common perception. Before the sudden death of my friend, the thought of dying never entered my mind. Even if it did, it was quickly dismissed. But thinking about it now, what would happen if God decided to take His breath back from me today or tomorrow. Am I confident enough to say that I am ready for Him and that I will be able to live eternally with Him? Have I lived a life worthy of a child of God? Have I done enough for God? Or more to the point, what have I done for God? How many times have I put God to one side and left Him there until I had a use for Him or needed Him? How many times have I been spiritually charged after attending church convocations, youth meetings and theological seminars but failed to maintain this high level of intensity in my faith after I leave each spiritual oasis? Does my renewed spiritual energy slowly deplete, unnoticed and unused? How many times have I procrastinated about drawing nearer to God because I am too wrapped up with my life and myself and am not quite willing to cut off or even loosen the ties I have with this world? How many times have I, moved by God's love and spirit, been determined to become a new person and to love God sincerely with all my heart, only to lose this motivation and drive when I encountered obstacles and succumbed to temptations? How many times have I pondered over and found excuses when asked to attend bible studies and church services, but readily accepted invitations to the cinema or to dinner? Embarrassingly, these times have been all too many. When we are enjoying life and everything is hunky-dory, we may develop a complacent attitude towards life, and more importantly towards the church and towards God. When this spiritual apathy becomes apparent to us, it is vital that we take the necessary steps to change for the better. Realization is the first step. Taking action to resolve our spiritual inertia is the key. Two skydivers, both wearing parachutes, jump from a plane at 15,000 feet in the air. One of the skydivers ignores the ripcord of his parachute and says to himself, ""I'm perfectly safe because of my parachute"" and still with this ignorant thought in mind, he is killed as he hits the ground at 100 mph. The other skydiver knows that just wearing the parachute will not save him. He must physically do something to avoid the fate of the other skydiver, so he pulls the ripcord of the parachute and lands safely. If we know we have to make a stronger commitment to God, we should take steps to do it while we still have the chance, whether it is to resolve to work more for God or to modify our priorities in life. If we are aware of our spiritual apathy, we should do something about it. We know too well that ""time waits for no man"". What if we gain the whole world, yet realize too late, that we have forfeited our soul? No compensation in this world is as valuable as our eternal life. Nothing could ever replace its loss. Jesus once related a parable about a certain landowner (Lk 12:16-21). This man was very rich, astute and intelligent, but Jesus called him a fool. Why? The reason was that this rich man misunderstood the meaning of life and what it took to fulfill it. He had laid up much good for himself for many years to come but then God told him that he was going to die that very night. What use are riches to the dead? He was a fool because he was so busy gathering his treasures in the material world that he did not think to lay up treasures in heaven. He failed to comprehend that his spiritual needs could not be satisfied through material means. The pursuit of money, prosperity and prestige had occupied his mind and time. How many of us today are just as foolish as him? It is necessary to work in order to take care of our physical needs, but the purpose of living itself calls us to go further than this ?to fulfill our spiritual needs. The fate of this rich fool should constantly remind us that what we perceive as being of great value might in fact be ultimately meaningless. The only riches that will retain its value and not depreciate with time are those that we invest in our eternal inheritance. These riches are only gained through fearing God, obeying His commandments and testifying for Him. But how many of us look that far ahead? We are constantly reminded through the news how death does not give any warning. Consequently, ""life should not be taken for granted"" ?how many times have we heard that adage? Unfortunately, many of us do take life for granted. Day after day we expect tomorrow to bring the start of another brand new day to be filled with work, rest, play and more memories. But what if tomorrow doesn't come to us? Have we ever seriously thought about it? Sometimes certain events like the sudden death of a young friend serve as a sharp reminder of how adversity may strike at any time and how fragile life really is. We should devote our lives to what really matters and not waste time striving after worldly success, prosperity and pleasure. These are understandable pursuits for those who do not know God. Believers, however, have to pursue goals that are everlasting and pleasing to God. King Solomon, the man with unprecedented wisdom and wealth, wrote Ecclesiastes not only to warn future generations (including us today) that the pursuit of wealth, power and excessive pleasure was a ""striving after wind"". He also wanted to spare them the pain of learning for themselves that without God, life is meaningless. Solomon had everything a man could desire but when he concluded that everything was vanity because all men will eventually die (Eccl 9:2-3), he had to search for true satisfaction elsewhere. The aged Solomon then took a reflective look at his life and ultimately concluded that the true meaning of life was simply to ""fear God and keep His commandments"" (Eccl 12:13). Everything else was vanity and a ""striving after wind"". He advised that even if we were to lose everything in the world, we still have God who is all we really need. No one knows for certain how many years God has granted each one of us. What is certain is that one day we will pass away. Paul's philosophy of life was simple: ""if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord."" Paul constantly wrote in his epistles how he did not fear death, how he considered his life and his possessions as refuse and how he longed to be with God. ""For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain""(Phil 1:21). But he knew that God had a purpose for him in this world. As long as God's breath of life was in him, he had to preach and to fight the good fight. He endeavored to imitate Jesus and urged others to follow his example (1 Cor 9:16-17). After his conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul understood the true meaning of his life. He was motivated to honor and glorify his Savior through boldly preaching Him. For the present, as we wait, we should live life judiciously and constantly examine and control the direction in our lives. We simply cannot afford to become complacent. If we find ourselves stuck in the doldrums, swift action needs to be taken. Thankfully, we are still living in a period of grace, but for how much longer? Bearing in mind that tomorrow is promised to no one, we should regard each new day as a gift from God and give thanks to Him. We should consider the advice of King Solomon and Apostle Paul and resolve to live and devote each day for our Lord ?to fear, to obey, to glorify and to serve Him until the day we die or the day our Lord returns. Only then will we be living a meaningful life both beneficial and satisfying to ourselves but most importantly, acceptable to God. Many people shudder at the mention of the word death. In fact, many people fear death because they fear the unknown and what will happen to them beyond life, as they know it. From a Christian's perspective, death should not be feared but embraced because the day has come when our Lord Jesus will gather us in His gentle arms and carry us into His heavenly kingdom. There is our final home, which our Lord has lovingly prepared for us, to live a new life free from toil and suffering (Jn 14:1-3). It is a world where tears are replaced with laughter, sorrow with joy, chaos with tranquility, war with peace, and hate with unconditional love. Although death ends our physical life on this earth, it is also the beginning of our eternal life with God in heaven. Everyone will eventually die, that is a fact. The question is ""ARE YOU READY""?"
1,667,"If God Is For Us, Who Can Be Against Us?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/1931-44_ex_fr_spelard_Godforus.html,"If God Is For Us, Who Can Be Against Us? Many people come to Jesus to find peace in their lives because He promised to give peace to His disciples. Some people, in particular, hope that by drawing near to the Almighty God, the creator of all things, their worries will cease to exist, thinking that the peace promised by Jesus is a peace from worldly cares: acquiring financial stability, living in a good neighborhood, and having good health. In the book of Romans, Paul encourages the church, writing, ""If God is for us, who can be against us?"" (Rom 8:31). Taken out of its context, this verse implies that nothing can oppose us if God is with us, for who can counter our success? So, we imagine living as a member of the upper class, being the president of a flourishing company, and being in vigorous health. Paul further asks, ""How shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?"" (Rom 8:32) and tells us that ""all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose"" (Rom 8:28). However, this letter, placed in its context, was written while the church was under terrible persecution. We learn that the believers were distressed, persecuted, and killed (Rom 8:35-36), and being a chosen heir of God meant suffering with Christ in order to be glorified with Him (Rom 8:17). From this, we see clearly that the world opposes those who give their heart to God. By measuring faith against material blessings or our vision of peace, we risk deceiving ourselves or, worse, setting ourselves up for failure. If we use an incorrect standard to assess the events in our life, we could come to fear that the slightest problem we encounter means we have been cursed, that becoming ill means we are being punished for having sinned, and that failure means God no longer loves us, even though we have been chosen for sanctification. What, then, is the meaning of ""God is with us""? RENEW OUR MIND First, the Bible teaches us that we must be renewed in our mind and must put on the new man, because relying on human understanding could estrange us from a life in God (Rom 8:17-24). For this reason, our Lord Jesus proclaimed that we must be born again to see the kingdom of God. Otherwise, we risk being like the crowds who trailed after Jesus for miracles, for healing, and for bread and failed to understand the true reason for following Christ. In fact, we could receive many types of material blessings yet pass by the word of God and the way to eternal life. Our Lord Jesus, therefore, commanded us to renew our mind, in order that we are not only able to see but also able to enter His kingdom and become a person pleasing to Him. For this purpose, He told us to seek first the kingdom of God and He would take care of our material needs, so that worldly matters would not occupy our thoughts and our time while we strived to do so. The mother of the sons of Zebedee was under the same misconception as the crowds when she asked Jesus to allow her sons to sit, one on His right and the other on His left, in His kingdom (Mt 20:20, 21). She was hoping that Jesus would make them His chief ministers. During this historical era, many believers were waiting for Christ to expel the Romans from their country and to take control. Jesus, seeing their lack of understanding, taught them to seek humility rather than the glory of the world. This new way of thinking is gained through a strict faith and sincere trust in the words of the prophets, Jesus, and the apostles. This trust in the Bible allows us to accept spiritual truth, which surpasses our wisdom, and to experience the grace and power of God in our life. The assiduous and genuine application that follows will ensure that we walk with God in His way. WALK IN THE WAY OF THE LORD To keep from becoming discouraged, we must strengthen ourselves through our trials, bearing in mind that all things work together for our good and that tribulations are a part of the way shown by the Lord. In fact, after Jesus received water baptism and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him like a dove, He was lead by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. And He was subjected to various forms of injustice and attack up until His death on the cross. Similarly, the apostles encountered persecution, slander, and sufferings shortly after the establishment of the church on the Day of Pentecost. We, too, may encounter difficulties in proportion to our strength. In our trials, we must remember that, as written by the apostle Paul to believers walking in the way of the Lord, ""all things work together for good""! Of course, we must discern between a test from God and a temptation from the devilâthe former edifies us and the latter causes us to fall when we forget to be vigilant. It is also for this reason that Paul emphasizes the fact that a blessing is, nevertheless, conditional and that we must walk according to the Spirit and not the flesh to please God. After baptism, we abide in Christ, and sin no longer has dominion over us (Rom 6:14-18), but we will still be tempted by carnal desires (Rom 8:1-8). To live in grace, therefore, we must become slaves of righteousness (Rom 6:19), bearing fruits that lead to holiness and eternal life (Gal 5:16, 24-25). By remaining firmly on this path, we will not fall into temptation. But how do tribulations and spiritual combat benefit us? SUFFERING FOR GOD IS A BLESSING By faith, we can easily accept going to battle for the Lord: it is a natural expression of our faith, our gratitude, and our love for Him. The apostles testified that fighting by His side is a wonderful experience and a tremendous privilege. We will not forsake those whom we love! After the apostle Paul escaped death at Lystra, he and Barnabas taught that tribulations lead to victory. From his experience, he saw that difficulties sanctify us by way of perseverance and hope. And we overcome our sufferings through the love of God. Like Stephen at his stoning, those who suffer for Christ will be shown the kingdom of God. They will be strengthened while serving Him, knowing that their temporary suffering is nothing compared to the indescribable joy that will await them when they can be by His side for eternity. The apostle Peter also exhorts us to rejoice when we are reproached for the name of Christ, because to suffer for doing good is a grace before God. We should not forget that our Lord Jesus, at the beginning of His ministry, taught this very principle in the beatitudes, saying that the kingdom of heaven is for those who are persecuted for righteousnessâ sake. Sufferings are not failings but are a grace of God. Common sense is reversed! True failure occurs when we return to sin and draw away from the love of both God and men. The purpose of these explanations is not to disclaim the material blessings of God, because they are abundant and do bring us much happiness, much like how nature flourishes after the rain. Rather, it is to help us understand that the blessings given by Him must not become an objective. Our goal is to make progress in our relationship with Him. Although Jesus, the Almighty, is with us as we travel on this path, we must understand that tribulations may arise, but they may also, by the miracle of faith and the grace of God, strengthen us and fill us with joy. This may be foolishness for men, but it is grace for the children of God. The injustice we suffer will sanctify us and strengthen us as we strive to love God and love men. God is with us to guide us in the way of excellence, a way that will bring us indescribable joy and peace beyond our comprehensionâa profound peace within the storm. And nothing can stop this from happening if we remain faithful, steadfast, and vigilant in His way."
1,683,How Do You Come Before God?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2009/How%20Do%20You%20Come%20Before%20God_683.htm,"How Do You Come Before God? How Do You Come Before God? Therefore I desire that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. (1 Tim 2:8) Imagine this: you have just stormed off in frustration from an unresolved argument with a friend. Your heart is filled with pain and anger as you kneel down and pray. You think that prayer will make the problem disappear, but you feel no peace and frustration builds the more you pray. Worse, the problem stays with you. Praying is supposed to comfort me and help me through this. Why am I still feeling this way? Yes, praying is good when a personal problem arises, but exactly how do you come before God? Let’s say you are chatting with your best friend in the park on a beautiful day, and you are pouring out the anger and anxiety that is in your heart. The more you talk, the angrier you get. What can your friend say while you are in this state of mind? He or she can probably say nothing because you would be too overcome by your emotions to let him or her edge in a thought or two. This is the same with God. We must not pray with anger, or while we are still holding a grudge. If the resentment lingers in your mind while you pray, there is no room for God to advise or comfort. We must reconcile and make friends with our enemies. Our conscience must be clear before we face God in our prayers. It is important to remind ourselves that it is by grace that we are able to pray. Everything we have comes by His grace. God has chosen us and wants us to pray and communicate with Him. Therefore, we must grasp every opportunity to pray, as prayer is a gift from God. Knowing this, we ought to examine ourselves before we kneel before Him, and we should think about what kind of prayers we are offering to God. We should give over our anger and frustrations to the Lord rather than complain and focus on how we had been wronged. If we fixate on the other person’s fault, this is our haughtiness and pride. We know that “God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble” (Jas 4:6). It is better for us to learn to focus on our own mistakes because that will be the beginning of our humility. Yes, He desires that we pray everywhere and come before Him. But His conditions are that we are holy and humble; without wrath and haughtiness. Questions for reflection: Have you ever prayed to God for comfort but received nothing? If so, was there a problem or argument on your mind at that time that was disturbing you?"
1,698,What Does the Lord Require of You?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/WhatDoesTheLordRequireOfYou.htm,"“What does the Lord require of you?” “What does the Lord require of you?” He has shown you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you? But to act justly , To love mercy, And to walk humbly with your God? –Micah 6:8 Many people might ask why God no longer lead us the way He led the people in the Old Testament times. Back then, when they inquired of the Lord, He would reveal His will to them either directly or through the prophets. Does He still lead us? Actually, yes, He does. Today, God directly guides us through the Scriptures. All we have to do is read it. And what does the Lord require of us? The answer given to this question is “to act justly, To love mercy, And to walk humbly with your God” (Mic 6:8). This verse could be used as a motto for our lives as followers of Christ. It gives us directions on how to handle the various situations in our day to day living. When we interact with people in society or at church, do we think about whether the things we do are just and fair? Or do we often act in a selfish manner? When we see someone who is in need of help, do we willingly show our mercy towards them or do we withhold ourselves and simply turn away? We face many different issues and problems in our lives. At times, we do not know the right way to handle certain situations. What we could do is ask: “What would God want me to do in a situation like this?” Should we follow what the Lord want us to do or do we just follow whatever our hearts desire? Are we humble enough to submit to God’s will? As Christians, we should make it our goal to know what God wants us to do. Doing the things that God requires of us would please Him, and our hearts would be joyful and filled with peace. Act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our Lord. Let us constantly remember these words and use them to guide us in our lives, because it will serves as the lamp to our feet and the light to our path. Question for reflection: What are some of the other important principles that you apply in your life in order to help you understand what God requires of you?"
1,830,Who Is Jesus?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/gs03jesuschrist01.htm,"Who Is Jesus? Who Is Jesus? Jesus is the most influential man that has ever lived. People through the centuries have talked about him, written about him, preached about him, and even died for him. How could he have such a profound and far-reaching impact on the whole world? In his days, Jesus performed miracles that no one had even heard of. He fed thousands of people with five loaves of bread and two fish. He walked on the sea. He calmed the storm. He opened the eyes of the blind, made the lame walk, and even raised the dead to life. Where did his supernatural power come from? Jesus promised his believers lasting spiritual fulfillment. He assured his followers that they would always have peace in their hearts. He even told the people that the only way to receive eternal life was to believe and follow him. What gave him the authority to offer these promises?"
1,853,Why Let Your Savior Wait?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/gs05baptism09.htm,"Why Let Your Savior Wait? Why Let Your Savior Wait? As much as God loves you, and as wonderful as Christ's salvation is, this love and salvation can come to you only if you are willing to repent of your sins, accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and are baptized into Christ. When the time comes for you to leave this world and face God's judgment, whether or not your sins have been paid for will be all that matters. Since we do not know when that time will come, we must heed this urgent calling: ""Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon"" (Isaiah 55:6,7). True faith means acting on what you believe once you understand God's word. Indecision is just unbelief in disguise. Christ has done everything. You don't need to wait until you are good enough for God, because no one can ever be good enough for God without the help of Christ. God is ready to accept you as you are, with all your brokenness, despair, and misery. You just have to make the choice of accepting him and his free gift of eternal life. Our loving Father is waiting patiently for you to come back to him. Why remain in the fleeting and deadly pleasure of sin when your loving Father is waiting with open arms, ready to welcome you into to the freedom and blessings in his house? Do not reject him any longer. Come back to God and start a new life with him today. ""And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name"" (Acts 22:16 )."
1,904,What Makes A Church?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/gs10church01.htm,"What Makes A Church? What Makes A Church? The word ""church"" has a two-fold meaning. The church is the congregation of believers in this world, and it is also the collective body of all believers in the past, present, and future. So the church in the Bible is not a place to go or a building to sit in. It is made up of people, God's people. It goes beyond national boundary, ethnic group, political alliance, or social status. With his own blood, Christ ""purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation"" (Revelation 5:9 NIV). Together, these believers constitute the church (Acts 20:28 ). Becoming a church member, however, is not a choice to join an organization for some common interest, but the acceptance of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. In a social organization, a few like-minded people can come together, set up a charter, and recruit members. But in the church, it is God who chooses people into the church. As our Lord said, ""you did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit"" (John 15:16 ). Through baptism, the blood of our Lord unites us as members of the church."
1,963,What Must I Do to Be Saved?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/gs04salvation03.htm,"ï»¿ What Must I Do to Be Saved? What Must I Do to Be Saved? Our salvation is by grace through faith. ""For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God--not because of works, lest any man should boast"" (Ephesians 2:8 ,9 ). We could not work our way to heaven by good deeds. We can only receive the free gift of salvation through our faith in Jesus Christ. While it is God alone who saves us by his grace, we need to respond to God's calling through faith in order to be saved. This response of faith is expressed through belief, confession, repentance, and obedience. Believe and Confess ""If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved"" (Romans 10:9). Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the way to receive salvation. Faith is more than mental consent. It means complete acceptance, trust, and dedication of ourselves to Christ. Faith must also persist throughout our lives. If we make a life-long commitment to the Savior, he will save us as he has promised. Not only do we need to believe and confess that Jesus is our Savior, we must also believe that the Bible, which testifies about Christ, is true. Furthermore, we need to become members of His true church, the body of Christ, because Christ has sent the church to preach the gospel of salvation and administer sacraments for salvation*. * For a more detailed explanation, please read the series titled Holy Bible and Church. Repent and Obey Repentance means turning back to God. It is a necessary act of faith. A repentant sinner must leave his sinful life and determine to obey God's word. He must walk by the Holy Spirit and aim for purity and love in his life. Obedience is the practice of faith. Without it, confession of the Lord's name would only be lip service. Although obedience by itself is not the basis of salvation, it demonstrates our faith in the Lord. The Lord Jesus said to a young man who asked about how to receive eternal life: ""If you would enter life, keep the commandments"" (Matthew 19:17 ). Receive the Sacraments Faith in the Lord also means accepting the sacraments. The sacraments, which are baptism, footwashing , and Holy Communion, are specific commands from our Lord that have God's saving effects. Christ washes our sins away in baptism. He offers us a part with him through footwashing . And he gives us his life through the Holy Communion. The use of physical actions or elements for the salvation of the soul is beyond rational explanation. But they are required according to the Lord's own word. If we have not received the sacraments, or have not done so in the manner taught in the Bible, we need to receive them in accordance with God's Word in order to be saved.* * For a more detailed explanation, please read the series titled Baptism, Footwashing , and Holy Communion."
1,1017,Do All Speak with Tongues?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/is_tongues03.htm,"Do All Speak with Tongues? Do All Speak with Tongues? A new question arises. If speaking in tongues is the sole criterion and evidence that one has received the Holy Spirit, then it must necessarily follow that all should speak with tongues. However, this seems an obvious contradiction to Paul’s rhetorical question: “Do all speak with tongues?” (1 Corinthians 12:30). A careful examination of the context in which the question was raised is needed here, as this will lead to the understanding that there are two functions of tongue-speaking. The listing of spiritual gifts serves to explain the diversities of gifts and roles different members receive. Hence, no single gift is shared by all. The other qualification is that these gifts must be “for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:7). Is tongue-speaking for the common good? Paul says no, for “he who speaks in a tongue edifies himself” (1 Corinthians 14:4). But tongue-speaking can be for the common good in some situations: “If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret” (1 Corinthians 14:27; cf. 14:5). Speaking in a tongue with interpretation communicates messages from God for the common good, and is thus one of the diverse gifts of the Spirit given separately to different believers. Such tongues are not spoken by all, and this is the answer to Paul’s question. Speaking in a tongue without interpretation is “speaking to himself and to God” (1 Corinthians 14:28 ). In this case the people need not be limited in number to two, or three, or speak in turn. For on the day of Pentecost, one hundred and twenty people spoke at one time. And in Ephesus , about twelve people spoke during one instance. Such tongues are spoken during prayer by all who have received God’s Spirit, as we have already examined. This is the main purpose of tongue-speaking: “For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit” (1 Corinthians 14:2). Tongues-Speaking in the True Jesus Church The emphasis placed on tongue-speaking in the True Jesus Church is linked directly to the importance of receiving the promised Holy Spirit. This is unlike the surge of interest in spiritual gifts (charismata) of the Holy Spirit among the Charismatics . Members of the True Jesus Church seek the gift of the Holy Spirit; the term “gift” ( dorea ) here is epexegetical , being the Holy Spirit Himself. Also, we do not reckon that speaking in tongues signifies a baptism in the Holy Spirit that is separate from receiving the Holy Spirit. The two go hand in hand. Speaking in tongues then, does not make one a superlative Christian, but is fundamental to every Christian, proving that he belongs to Christ (Romans 8:9). The ability to speak in tongues remains with a person after he receives the indwelling Holy Spirit. Each time a Christian or a congregation of believers prays in the Spirit, this ability is made possible by the Holy Spirit. Since this phenomenon of congregational tongue-speaking has been criticized as unscriptural, we shall discuss it in light of the Scriptures. Many have frowned upon the public display of tongue-speaking for the following reasons: 1. No one understands, not even the speaker himself. “For no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit” (1 Corinthians 14:2). “For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful” (1 Corinthians 14:14). 2. Paul limited the number of speakers, even when there is interpretation. “If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret” (1 Corinthians 14:27). 3. Unbelievers may mistake it for madness. “If, therefore, the whole church assembles and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?” (1 Corinthians 14:23). The fact that tongues are unknown languages should not inhibit our prayers, for “the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words” (Romans 8:26). Moreover, Paul himself remedies the situation he poses: “What am I to do? I will pray with the Spirit and I will pray with the mind also” (1 Corinthians 14:15 ). We can participate with our minds when we pray in the Spirit. The Scriptures show that tongues bestowed upon believers when they receive the Holy Spirit are not spoken by two or three in turn. The praying saints on the day of Pentecost numbered about one hundred and twenty. The Ephesian disciples numbered about twelve. We see, then, that when tongues are not specifically directed at any human audience, as in prayer, no restriction in number applies. From the above, we also come to realize that whenever Paul instructs the Corinthian believers to curb the speaking of tongues, he refers to another function, that is, the preaching in tongues (1 Corinthians 14:19, 28). Unbelievers will think that we are mad if we speak to one another in tongues. When the entire congregation prays to God in tongues in an orderly manner, however, it becomes a sign to the unbelievers (1 Corinthians 14:22 ). Inevitably, there will be those who will not benefit from this sign, such as the mockers on the day of Pentecost who remarked, “They are filled with new wine” (Acts 2:13 ). Nevertheless, the sign of tongues coupled with Peter’s sermon converted three thousand souls on that day."
1,5571,Software Piracy - Is it Wrong?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/th_us_echang_software_6.htm,"SOFTWARE PIRACY—IS IT WRONG? SOFTWARE PIRACY—IS IT WRONG? Enoch Chang— Houston , Texas , USA From a technological standpoint, two of the greatest and most influential achievements of recent time have been the advent of the personal computer and the deployment of the internet. Multifaceted, each is useful for virtually every type of application. Used in both our personal and professional lives, they have become an integral part of society. However, since they can be used for such a wide variety of purposes, the question is, what do we use them for? EVERYBODY DOES IT King Solomon, with his God given-wisdom, once said, That which has been is what will be , That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun. Is there anything of which may be said “See, this is new”? It has already been in ancient times before us. (Eccl 1:9, 10) Reading Solomon’s statement, you can’t help but wonder what exactly he means. As humans our life is composed of new encounters that become our experience. But unfortunately since a person cannot be born with the knowledge and experience of others there is no advantage to being born today as opposed to being born yesterday, since his/her experience is unique. Solomon is saying that what we face today are the same things everyone else faced yesterday and the same things everyone else will face tomorrow. Everyone has “been there” and “done that.” And in any given circumstance, we still have to make decisions between right and wrong. There is nothing new about the choices that people face in their lives, just a change in how it appears with time. The same thing can be said of sin. Since the beginning of time, men have sinned against God. But the enticements of Satan have evolved quite dramatically since Adam and Eve ate of the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. So, if what Solomon said is true, that nothing really changes and sin exists, then the question for us as Christians today isn’t “have we” but “how are we” sinning against God? For we who live in the technological age, we still need to make decisions of right and wrong, but Satan has grown more deceptive to fool us. He now knows to make use of seemingly non-religious scenarios so that we are less sensitive to our conscience. If you ask a college or high school student what they primarily use the computer and internet for, you’ll probably get a response similar to: check email, surf the web for news and sports, blog , chat with friends, sell and buy things online, play computer games, make web pages, do homework and research, look at pictures, stay updated with their hobbies (fixing up their car, latest video games, latest tech stuff, etc), burn CD’s, and more. For the most part, this isn’t a bad list of things to do, although whether or not it’s a good usage of time is debatable. But things get interesting when you ask them what exactly they burn to CD, what they download, where they got the game they’re playing from, and how they got the software to make their web pages. IT’S NO BIG DEAL Of all the hundreds, possibly thousands, of Mosaic laws the Israelites had to observe, we have to remember only ten of them. But these ten laws are not just lifeless words that we must remember. For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. (Heb 4:12) God’s word is the weapon of choice to combat sin because, just as sin changes it’s form with time, God’s word is applicable all the time. But God’s word is useful to us only if we recognize our target. For some reason or another, our ideology or philosophy of stealing doesn’t seem to have kept up with the advancements of technology. In most cases, the word stealing is usually associated only with taking something from a grocery store, robbing someone at gun point, or breaking into someone’s house and taking their belongings. What we don’t associate stealing with is downloading illegal mp3’s and bootleg videos, cracking trial versions of software, burning copies of copyright-protected CD’s, and performing other “cost-saving” measures. Maybe we admit it’s a form of stealing, but somehow it’s just not the same as robbing a bank. This is the dilemma we face today. We know what the Bible says, but we don’t realize how it applies today, which ultimately says that we don’t always know when we’re wrong. WHAT’S THE PROBLEM? To society we’re referred to as students, children, and young adults. From that point of view, we’re no different from the next person. But, there is a difference. We’re religious education teachers, counselors, youth group leaders, and Christians. How can we live up to these roles—roles that are supposed to glorify God—if we ourselves make excuses for the “less important” wrongdoings we practice? Moreover, how can we expect younger youths and non-believers to know what is right if we’re teaching them to do what is wrong? Right after teaching a lesson on the Ten Commandments, being honest, or being separate from the world, we sometimes ask our students for or give them copied software, videos, or songs. Sometimes, we even ask if they can help with various church works, which may require certain computer programs, but we adhere to a no-questions-asked policy on how they get the software or even worse, give them the illegal program to use. This gives them the impression that this kind of activity is condoned. Or how many times have we swapped CD’s with friends we invite to church? We want them to come to know God and to know the truth, but we don’t seem to practice the truth ourselves because our life doesn’t reflect it. Yes, we know the basic beliefs and teachings of the Bible, observe the Sabbath, and say we don’t celebrate various holidays because they’re not biblical, but, when it comes down to the small daily issues of life, we’re just like everyone else. Luke 16:10 says, “He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.” Here Jesus gives us a good guideline on how to judge character—look at the little things. If we’re found faithful in the little things, then that means we’re also considered faithful in the big things. We have to wonder if we’re faithful in the little things that we let pass by, thinking it’s no big deal. Setting a bad example is just one of many problems with software piracy. It can lead to other forms of stealing, incur legal woes, encourage us to lie about using pirated software, and hinder our relationship with God. Whenever we serve God, we’re actually offering our best to Him. But if we’re using pirated software in our service to Him, are we offering our best? In Mark 11, Jesus grew upset and cast out those who were doing business in the temple and “would not let anyone to carry ‘wares’ through the temple.” Jesus’ rash actions may sound a bit harsh because we may not think what we’re doing is all that condemning. But the severity of software piracy—especially when we use church as a medium to pass on these things to other members—effectively put a shameful blanket on our conduct in the house of God. If Jesus was displeased with the sight at the time, what would Jesus do if He saw us with our stolen goods in His temple today? Jesus once said, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (Mt 22:21 ). This reminds us that we may be Christians, but we also live in this society and must be compliant to what our society requires of us, that is, to do the right thing and to observe the laws. START WITH OURSELVES The first step we need to take is to reconnect with the source of truth, which is God Himself. Just like a virus-scanning program needs to connect with a central server to stay updated on the latest virus definitions, we need to stay connected with God in order to have the wisdom to see the new variations of sin. This entails not only reading the Bible and praying on a consistent basis to build up sensitivity towards sin but also looking carefully at our lives and keeping up with the newest issues in society. Our task in life as Christians is to shine the light for Christ, which means we have to live in the world and not flee to some hole in the ground, fearing that we’ll be influenced by all the evils of society. Instead we should be active participants in society and be aware of new trends and ideologies. Then, we must use the Bible to discern whether these “new” things are actually sin in disguise. If we’re able to do this and constantly keep our database of sin updated, then we have a much higher probability of not being ignorant towards sin and all its forms. Today’s society is all about being on the forefront of cutting-edge technology. Likewise, we need to be on the forefront to recognize the many faces of sin. HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE Software piracy, unfortunately, is only one of many problems that we face today. With much advancement in science and technology, many old problems have surfaced in new ways. Knowing that software piracy is wrong and is very much a form of stealing doesn’t mean that it is easy for us to stop the practice. For most, software piracy is a gratuitous way to watch the latest movies, have the latest software, and listen to whatever songs we want. It even keeps us educated because it provides uninhibited access to whatever programs we would like to learn how to use. Since there are so many reasons and “benefits” of using pirated software, as well as the fact that it has become a large part of our lives, determining to stop alone may not be good enough. However, if we hold each other accountable as a group and really have it in our hearts to stop the practice, then curbing the habit will be much easier. The Bible says, “Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken” (Eccl 4:12). In practical terms, this means limiting our computer time, deleting peer-to-peer software, becoming more aware of what our church students and siblings are doing on the computer, and actually being open about the topic with our spiritual companions. If we are able to address the issue rather than ignore it, then we’re well on our way to devising a solution. We need to get the message across that software piracy is unacceptable. The problem presented by software piracy has ballooned to such a catastrophic extent that numerous software and music companies are beginning to search for people using illegal software and prosecuting them. If not for any other reason, we should encourage those we care about to stop for their own good. Even if the person is older than ourselves, perhaps even our youth leader, we must courageously broach the subject with them. We’re all in the same boat trying to get to the same place. Even if some of us don’t seem interested in reaching the final destination, we can’t just leave them behind. We have to support each other and push together."
1,5651,Can I Influence My Children?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/en/article/ff_us_pchen_influence_6.htm,"“CAN I INFLUENCE MY CHILDREN?” “CAN I INFLUENCE MY CHILDREN?” Patricia Chen — Irvine, California, USA Parent:“I said it’s time to put your toys away.” (No response) “I’m going to count to three.” (Silence) “One, two, three…three…three. Did you hear what I just said? I said it’s time to put away your toys, brush your teeth, say a prayer , and go to sleep.” (Voice raised) Child: “Okay, I heard you but I’m still playing, c an you count again?” Does this sound familiar? Parenting indeed is a challenging job. We try our best to guide our children, but it feels like they are the ones who are controlling us. Sometimes, they don’t even seem to hear what we are saying. Most North Americans believe that parents have less influence on their children than school and the media. With their busy lifestyle, some parents assume daycare, school, and television programming play the primary roles in molding their children. Even at church, some parents are buying into the myth that there is little they can do to shape the lives of their children. Subsequently, we have lost confidence in raising moral kids. DO I REALLY HAVE INFLUENCE OVER MY CHILDREN? I remember before we had our child, my husband and I were very concerned about what kind of parents we would be. Even today, we constantly explore the Bible and see what the word of God teaches us about parenting. Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed just thinking about all of the dangers and uncertainties my child will face as he grows up. I fear for his safety, but most of all I fear for his soul, mind, and spirit. The fact is, the world we live in has lost its moral compass. The media thrive on unrealistic and dangerous messages that can easily defile our purity. When our children fill up on movies with immoral images, violent television, or music with profane lyrics, they will be adversely affected. Nevertheless, as I continue to search the Scriptures and pray, I am convinced that God offers help and strength to any parent who wants to grab hold of these fleeting years to mold the next generation. Behold, children are a gift of the Lord; The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, So are the children of one’s youth, How blessed is the man who quiver is full of them; They shall not be ashamed, When they speak with their enemies in the gate. (Ps 127:3-5) I refer to our time as fleeting years because, as parents, we do not own our children. God has said that they are gifts and rewards, and He has only entrusted our children to us for a brief window of time. So the day we release our children, our arrows, we must release them into the world without letting our fears hold us back. When we let them go, they need to be prepared to aim toward the right target, like real warriors. Moses’ Parents and Their Hall of Faith Take the example of Moses’ parents. We can learn precious lessons about taking every opportunity to raise our children from a couple that lived four thousand years ago. What set them apart was their perception of God’s vision for their son. First of all, they risked their lives for their baby because they realized that he was not an ordinary child. Being fearful of the Pharaoh’s mandate to extinguish every first-born male, they bravely went against the king’s orders and hid baby Moses for three months (Heb 11:23). What a faith they must’ve had to devise such a plan for Moses’ rescue! Standing on the river bank, they released their baby into God’s guidance as he waded across the water. Much to their surprise, God intervened immediately and brought him to the Pharaoh’s palace. Moses’ mother, seeing such a grand opportunity, offered to be a caretaker to this adopted baby of the royal family. Over the years, she taught him all the ways of God and raised him as a true Israelite. This was her hall of faith. So the question is: “Do I really have influence over my children?” Yes, we can significantly influence our children with godly values and directions. Undoubtedly, teachers, grandparents, friends, the media, and society will also influence our children’s lives, but it is God’s purpose for parents to carry out this title role, and we need to bravely assume it. While we are raising young children or teens, we might not know what our children will grow up to be. But with God’s guidance, we can raise them with the wisdom, strength, and vision that come from God. He already knows their purposeful life. So it is our duty as parents to help our children discover the amazing plans our heavenly Father has prepared for them. WHAT SHOULD A PARENT DO? As a parent, one of our goals is to raise our children to be morally and socially responsible. Eventually, they will go to college. At that time, will they do the right thing even after they have left our supervision? With God’s vision and with persistent prayers, they will, because of what has been instilled in them in their upbringing. According to many studies, a child’s primary relationship is with his parents in the first phase of life. Children care a great deal about what their parents think and do. Basically, from infant to about pre-adolescence, their lives circle around their parents. Then, there comes a point during adolescence where the primary relationship shifts from parents to friends as they learn to interact socially. Some parents fear letting go. However, it is healthy for them to learn to interact with others in a mature and constructive way. The more assuring way to do that is to have confidence that we have influenced them in a godly and spiritual manner over the years. Sometimes, we will feel inadequate in one way or another in influencing our children’s lives. But focus on a few areas at a time. God yearns for us to make Him our foundation, upon whom we build our children’s faith. Even though many Christ-like qualities bear so little impact in our society today, we know that they matter tremendously in the kingdom of God . There seem to be so much to work on: submission to parents and to God, obedience, respect for authority, growth in their faith, wisdom, courage to do the right thing, self-discipline, integrity, moral purity, overcome temptations, love, perseverance, a heart of discernment between truth and falsehood. The list can go on. Rather than overwhelming ourselves, we can choose several areas to focus on because certain topics become more relevant than others depending on the age and the maturity of the child. Our goal is to divide and conquer—one attitude and one behavior at a time. From Infancy to Pre-adolescence: Setting Rules, Guidelines, Boundaries, and Discipline For young kids, the first step is to mold their character while their will is more bendable. Some parents set rules and guidelines for behavior. I always tell my child to “listen and obey Mommy and Daddy.” By that, I want my child to respond immediately and respectfully. Of course, this is easier said than done because most children will rebel some of the time, and especially the strong-willed child. But parents should instill in them what obedience is all about. When my child was younger, he always challenged me by playing before doing homework. It took us a long time to instill in his heart what obedience is—doing things without complaining. Memorizing Bible verses is also a power tool for young children. When they memorize and learn the verses in the early years, it will survive them through the turbulent teenage period. We don’t need to have a doctorate degree in theology in order to teach biblical concepts to our children. Children have very simple faith, and they just need to believe the words of God and obey His teachings. One of the worst things that can happen to a child is parents who send mixed signals about what is acceptable or unacceptable. This usually happens early on because one parent may have experienced a stern upbringing and the other a tolerant childhood. As a result, they resist doing the same thing to their own children and end up with incongruent expectations. What we want to achieve as parents is to agree on one set of family rules and reinforce them over and over again, especially at a young age. Of course, it takes a lot of patience and hard work. But it is something that will pay off in the long run. From Pre-adolescence to Young Adults: Fostering Loving Relationships and Responsibility, and Making Wise Decisions At about 12 or 13 years of age, it’s as though our child is constantly telling or hinting to us they want the freedom and power to make decisions. The little child we embraced in our arms for years now thinks he is like an adult and he wants to have some control of his fate. No wonder many parents feel they have already lost when it comes to the battle of raising teenagers. One thing we need to keep in mind at this age is that the peer group has become the most important influence to our children. Also, peer pressure from friends forces them to seek an identity of their own. The question, then, is what do we train at this age? Reinforcing rules is still very important. Otherwise they will not have any structure in their lives. But remember that, behind rules, we have to have a good relationship. One close friend of mine told me that her parents always told her “No” without giving her a reason. When asked about a rule, instead of saying, “Because I say so,” explain the reasons behind it. Teenagers want to know the why’s behind the rules before they follow it. Otherwise, it can turn into rebellion. Always be there and tell them how much you love them. Don’t assume they know it. When they get all the love they need from us, they won’t turn to the world to satisfy their needs. If we have been setting aside time during the day in which we pray with them when they were young, this should also continue as they step into their adolescence. Young people have a desire for responsibility. It is a sign that they are starting to grow up. Give them more chances to make decisions about what they want to do with their free time. Start out with small decisions. See how they decide and what they choose. Once they show themselves faithful in small matters (like going out with their friends and coming home on time), we can allow them to make bigger choices. One parent told me that their teenagers always come home on time because they have learned to respect their parents and be responsible at a young age. One of the biggest tasks is to teach our teenagers how to make wise choices. Listen to what they have to say after they’ve made a bad choice. Ask, “Well, if you were in the same situation again, would you do the same thing? Why or why not?” Give them wise advice. Go back and talk about those issues so that they can make better choices going forward in their lives. The biggest struggle as parents is deciding what types of decisions they are allowed to make. For example, let’s look at dating at an early age. Most parents will agree that they are too young or not mature enough. We need to tell them the proper time to date and why we want them to refrain from dating. When we see them grow in a mature and responsible way, then we can let them make almost all the decisions about life in their late teens. PASSING ON OUR FAITH Paul wrote: “I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also” (2 Tim 1:5). What a great example to know that as grandparents and parents, we can set a good example of faith to our children. As parents, one of our goals is to let our children see that our relationship with God is the most important in our lives. If our children can see our genuine faith, it will have a tremendous affect on their spiritual development. Let God be so naturally involved in family conversations and issues that our children can identify God to be their own. It has been said that the best way to impact another life is to apply what one teaches. Even though we might have been neglecting our faith before having children, it is not too late to begin now. Jesus told us the parable about building the foundation on the rock. When the flood and winds came, the rock was left standing strong. What kind of foundation have we been laying down for our children? Do we have family Bible reading time? Do we pray together every morning and before we go to bed? Do we use teachable moments? For example, in any given situation we can respond with God as the solution: “God helped us when we prayed for….” “Wow, God is amazing, He took care of us during…” “Look at all the yummy food that we have for this meal, it is all God’s goodness…” “Sometimes, mom and dad can’t be with you at school or elsewhere, but God is always available to guide you when you call on Him.” One day, my son told me in the car, “Mom, thank God that we have God to pray to. He is bigger than anything, right?” What a blessing to know that we are building a lasting heritage. This world we live in is so seductive and alluring, who knows how long our children can be shielded under our roof? We should continue to strive with the help of God to educate their heart and mind about Him. Remember, God has given us the gift of a few critical years to leave a legacy of faith and godly character for our own children. DO NOT LEAVE TRAINING TO CHANCE Some parents make it their priority to give their children the best education and learning environment when it comes to school. But they just assume that religious education at church should take the primary role to lead their children to God. The truth is: that is not enough. Why? Remember that the very first institution God established was the family—building a legacy of faith first before He established the church. Of course, that doesn’t mean that religious education at church is not important. It definitely plays a vital role in our children’s faith, but why not give our children the best of both worlds? Nothing is comparable to the eternal value of the saved souls of our beautiful children. When our children show reverence for God; when they pursue joy, peace, and love; when they resist sin, temptation, and stand up for what is right even though they are standing alone; and when they want to serve God not because you tell them to but because they are willing from their heart, we will be glad that we invested much time and energy towards their spiritual lives. With all this said, I am not an expert in this field and I often have to juggle the demands of parenthood and God’s holy work. The only solution is to get on my knees, realizing how weak I am in faith, and turn to God for strength and wisdom. I continue to ask God to inspire us, regardless of how strenuous the days may look, and for Him to empower us to pray anytime and anywhere with our children. …Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift your hands toward Him For the life of your young children… (Lam 2:19) May God give us the wisdom to mentor our children, and to aim high and train them diligently by the power of God’s word. After all, “He who began a good work in [us] will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus” (Phil1:6)."
1,6409,Do We Care?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M21-Do%20We%20Care_6409.htm,"Do we care? Do we care? LEE JIN IN THE SUMMER OF 1992, attention was once again drawn to the plights of the people in Africa . Newspapers reported how famine, war and debt were threatening the Lives of 40 million people there. In Somalia , the situation was so severe that relief workers rounded numbers of dead to the nearest 10,000. 1.5 million of the country’s estimated 6 million faced imminent starvation. Worse may be yet to come. Drought has also struck the southern part of the continent, creating an arid swath through 11 countries. But Africa is only an example. In the floods that swept Pakistan in September 1992, at least 2,500 people were drowned. This natural disaster, one of the worst in 45 years, destroyed innumerable villages, food crops and livestock, and left tens of thousands homeless. Relief organizations had to airlift food and subsistence for these victims. To us, these crises may seem far removed from our every day life. So many have occurred in recent years that we have come to accept them as nothing more than just another piece of news, another set of statistics to support the view that the Lord’s second coming is near. Besides, places like Africa and Pakistan are like a world apart from those of us living in stable, affluent societies. Yet, poverty, homelessness and deprivation exist even in our own backyards. As Christians, do we have an obligation to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings? Indeed, our hearts may be moved when we are confronted with malnourished faces staring hauntingly at us from our television screens. And we feel sorry for the homeless that wander around in our cities begging, who live rough and have to make do with cardboard boxes for protection at night. But are such expressions of sympathy on our part sufficient? Doesn’t God expect us to do more? There are children rejected by their parents, elderly men and women forgotten by their families, people who through no fault of their own have found themselves jobless and even homeless… such human suffering and social deprivation are all around US, if only we take the time to look. As part of His divine plan, God incarnated into the human plane some two thousand years ago, to open a way for humanity to return to Him. He achieved this through the blood He shed on the cross. When a person confesses his sins, repents and receives baptism in the mode as prescribed by the Bible, he will have the living hope of eternal life. Yet more than this, while Jesus was in this world, He also led an exemplary life for all future generations to emulate. If we are to follow Him, we have to walk the way He did ( Jn 12:26). In order to search for a Christian answer for the questions posed above, we have to return to the Scripture. During His brief ministry, the Lord Jesus travelled through the land of Palestine , from Galilee in the north, to Judaea in the south. Along His journeys, He encountered many lost souls who, deprived of God, were wandering aimlessly through life. So He preached to them about the Kingdom of God (Mt 4:17), the need to repent and be reconciled once again with God. But Jesus did not preach this message in oblivion of everything else. He also catered for the physical well-being of those around Him. As the Scripture testifies, He performed miracles of food to feed the crowd (Mt 14:13-21 ,15:32 -38), and miracles of healing to relief human sufferings (Mt 4:23-24, 15:30). The author of Matthew aptly summarizes the Lord’s ministry as one of preaching and healing (Mt 4:23, 9:35). What is more, the message of salvation and the miracles were not confined to the Jews. Jesus’ disciples had to “go and make disciples of all nations” (Mt 28:19). In the last days, “men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit at the table in the kingdom of God” ( Lk 13:29). Just as the message of salvation was universal, so were the miracles. As He fed the four thousand, He did not instruct His disciples to distribute only to His own people. All who were present received a share of this providential care (Mt 15:29-38). In Capernaum , He did not turn down the request of the centurion to heal his servant (Mt 8:5-13). And once travelling along the border between Samaria and Galilee , He healed ten lepers, one of whom was a Samaritan, member of a community which did not associate with the Jews ( Lk 17:11-19; Jn 4:9). In many instances, the Lord Jesus’ actions were prompted by His compassion. Time and time again, the Gospel writers attested to this fact. When He saw the widow of Nain mourning for her son’s death, Luke states that Jesus “had compassion on her” and resurrected her son ( Lk 7:13). The author of Mark relates that during the early days of His ministry, a leper approached Jesus for healing, and his request was granted because Jesus was “moved with pity” for him (Mk 1:40-41). Once, as Jesus was leaving Jericho , two blind men sitting by the roadside heard Him passing and cried out for help. Matthew records that Jesus “in pity” healed them (Mt 20:29-34). Even the feeding of the four thousand was an act of compassion. When Jesus saw how the crowds continued to stay with Him, He admitted to His disciples that He had compassion for the crowd and was unwilling to send them away on empty stomachs. As they had been with Him for three days, He feared that they might faint along their journey home (Mt 15:32-39). As previously illustrated, Jesus cared for his fellowmen and did what He could for them. And in this respect, the greatest deed He undertook was the giving of His life in exchange for their souls. Deeply moved by this gesture, the apostle Paul confessed that the reason he lived a God-centered life was that Jesus, the Son of God, loved him and gave Himself for him (Gal 2:20). Today, it is through this gift of God that we have the hope of eternal life, and which enables us to lead a meaningful existence in this often incomprehensible world. As we meditate on this saving grace, we also have to remember that we, as His followers, have to emulate Him, and practise charity as part of our Christian living. Indeed, the Lord Jesus has taught us the essence of giving, that such acts should be prompted by our hearts. After all, Christianity is a religion of the heart, of faith built upon inner conviction. It involves knowing whom and what we believe in, and manifesting this belief through our speech and our conduct, as a testimony to the world that we are the followers of the One who came to bring hope to a world without hope. So it should be that from our innermost being, the compassion in us is to be externalised into actions. Only then will we be able to give to humanity whatever is within our ability, not because we have to, but because we want to. Jesus has shown us that compassion itself is insufficient. He not only had compassion for the needy. He actually helped them. As He travelled , He saw the human miseries which touched His kind and tender nature. And He did what He could to remove the pain and suffering. As His followers, we have to turn our feelings of compassion and sympathy into actions to find ways of helping and giving. After all, it is very easy to feel for those who are less fortunate but it takes courage to actively help them. Just consider, how many times have we stopped short of contributing to some worthwhile charity? Perhaps we were just about to write a cheque for a good cause and we stopped when we thought of the financial loss to us, or perhaps we had joined up for a task force to care for the homeless but we pulled out at the last minute when we realized the demand on our time. Another touching feature in the Lord Jesus’ acts is in the way He gave without condition. He did not select the recipients of His care. The crowd irrespective of gender and creed received His grace. As His followers, this point is important. We are to extend our charity, without bias, to all who are in need, just as our heavenly Father gives sunshine and rain to both the righteous as well as the unrighteous (Mt 5:45). As Christians, we are still part of society. Whilst we have to be vigilant not to be influenced by its decadence and falling morals, we cannot segregate ourselves. The Lord Jesus wants us to be the “light of the world” to set good examples such that others can see Him in us. We can only achieve this through social interactions with them. Therefore, let us not isolate ourselves but strive to increase our awareness of society’s needs, not only in terms of their spiritual welfare, but also in terms of their daily well being. While we do not wish to give to the extent where our focus shifts from the spiritual to the social, we must not let our lack of caring make our preaching hypocritical Os 2:14-16). And when we do take a closer look at the world around us, we see the depressed, the homeless, the handicapped, the abused, the poor and the list is endless. How can we not care and help? The time has come for us to re-assess the meaning of following on the footsteps of our Lord Jesus. He had a compassionate and caring nature. He led a life of giving. And He contributed to the society of His days. Have we really emulated Him? The Christian faith is a dynamic faith, one which constantly breaks new ground and soars new heights. As we learn more about the God we believe in and His expectations of us, let us search our hearts and re-appraise our values. Let us lend a helping hand to ‘ neighbours ’ less fortunate than us, to take the opportunity whilst we still can, to show that we care. Let us not turn a blind eye at the miseries of this world. Christians, like their kind and compassionate Master, have to live up to the axiom: it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). [The sequel ‘Caring in Action’ to be published in a future issue, will present some practical ways of caring for our neighhours.]"
1,6411,"Mum and Dad, What Shall I Be?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M21-MU_1_6411.htm,"REMEMBER DORIS DAY?S ?Que Sera, Sera? VINCENT YEOH REMEMBER DORIS DAY’S “Que Sera, Sera”? What if your own little kid comes up to you and asks, “What shall I be?” What is the single most important thing you would impart to your child? You do not need to drive into your child the necessity of earning living. Society will do that for you. At every turn, newspapers, magazines, movies, television and radio glamorise the making of money. Almost everybody loves money and so loves to talk about money — how to get it, what to do with it or who has it. You also do not need to push your child to study hard. The very day your child steps into a classroom, he is already on a conveyor belt that goes at an ever increasing speed until he reaches the other end with a degree or until he drops out. Strangely, many Christian parents, like other parents, stress the importance of a good career and a good education when it is totally unnecessary to do so. ‘What does God want Christian parents to tell their children? First we must understand this fact: Children are a heritage from the Lord (Psalms 127:3). Your child belongs to God. God makes you a guardian and places the child under your care. Your child is not yours for you to mould as you desire. Your child is not an extension of yourself to fulfil your dreams. Your child is God’s heritage for you to bring up in the way of the Lord to achieve this supreme plan. From the beginning this was God’s charge to Abraham as a parent: “I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice; so that the Lord may bring to Abraham what He has promised hi m.” (Genesis 18:19) Note that God did not charge Abraham to charge his children to get milk and honey. Abraham was to charge his children to keep the way of the Lord and they will be blessed with a land flowing with milk and honey as the Lord had promised. The same charge was laid upon the nation of Israel when Moses repeated the laws of God in the wilderness: “And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk to them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.” (Deuteronomy 6:6-7) This same charge now applies to you as a parent. When you are with your kids, what do you talk about? Asaph the psalmist says: ”Tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and His might, and the wonders which He has wrought....so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments.” (Psalms 78.4-7) Emphasize the way of the Lord. Impress in the mind of your child the laws of God. Then he will set his hope in God. When a person’s hope is in God, he will not be moved. Speak to him about the glorious deeds of the Lord and all the good things God has bestowed on your family. Let your child know that the Lord is good. Teach him to trust in God. Warn him against disobeying God. God is a God of love. God is also a God of justice. When a person disobeys God, God will punish. Your child must learn this. If you accept that this is your duty as a parent, then the next time your child asks, “What shall I be?”, you will say, “You are a child of God to be used by Him as He wills,” However all these are merely words if your actions do not confirm that you really believe what you have told him. Children learn so much from what you do arid what you say. When you say that it is important to put God first in everything and yet tell him that he may stay at home to study instead of going to church for services or for religious education classes, you are confusing your child by sending him conflicting messages. Parents must realise that attending church services including religious education classes has never adversely affected a Christian youth’s studies, I have been baptised for about 20 years and have worked with Christian youths for not less than 15 years but I have never known or heard of a Christian youth’s studies suffer because of attending church services. On the other hand, I have seen many active Christian youths who excel in their studies. Therefore when you teach your child the importance of worship, it is your duty to show him you mean what you say by actually bringing him to church (if he is still young) or encouraging him to attend religious education classes on his own, In this way, you are giving him a clear message that God is most important. The same applies to all other teachings you impart to your child. You must show by your example what you teach."
1,6415,Who Can Enter the Kingdom of God?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M21-WH_1_6415.htm,"Who can THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT AN EARTHLY ONE. It exists in a spiritual dimension not detectable by our carnal senses. It is a realm where God reigns sovereign, a habitation which He prepared for us even before the creation of the world. Such a kingdom cannot be shaken and will never change, for it is untainted by earthly sorrow, sickness or death; aptly called the kingdom of Heaven . This enviable place is the ultimate goal of every Christian, and his greatest hope. If anyone has hope in Christ only in the present life, he is of all men most pitiable (1 Cor 15: 19). But Jesus said, “Not every one who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’, shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven ; but he that does the will of my father who is in Heaven” (Mt 7:21) and also, “Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves” (Mt 23:15). These are serious remarks which demand serious pondering and self-evaluation. ENTRY REQUIREMENTS Every believer properly taught in the fundamentals understands the necessity to be “born of water and the Spirit” ( Jn 3:5) — that one must be baptised for the remission of sins and must receive the Holy Spirit for his constant renewal (Tit 3:5). However, the full implication of being born of the Spirit — the utter transformation of our carnal nature into one that reflects the very spiritual qualities of the son of God (Rom 8:29; 12:2), has not always been sufficiently stressed. What then are the marks of grace manifested by one who would eventually be accepted into the pearly gates? Childlikeness All four Gospels bear the account of people bringing their young ones before the Lord Jesus so that He might touch them. When His disciples tried to stop them, Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter it” (Lk 18:15-17). This incident clearly tells us that people in the kingdom of God are like little children. Therefore the most lovable and beautiful period of a person’s life is his childhood, wherein one may almost catch glimpses of man’s original guilelessness and innocence. This suggests that though infants are born with depraved natures, the ability to sin increases only with age, just as does understanding. So Paul reminds us, “Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be babes in evil, but in thinking, be mature” (1 Cor 14:20). The Corinthian believers should not be babes in understanding but be mature. Transcending , Pharisaic, Righteousness Jesus taught His disciples, “For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven ” (Mt 5:20). “Righteousness” refers to doing what is right in the eyes of God. In order to enter the kingdom of Heaven , our behaviour must excel over that of the Scribes and Pharisees. From the teachings of the Lord Jesus, we know that the Scribes and Pharisees were not ignorant of doing righteous deeds. They were taught from the Books of the Law and they placed special emphasis on displaying before others, their ardent devotion in observing the Law. As recorded in the Gospel according to Luke, a Pharisee would say these words when he is praying in the temple, “God, I thank thee that I am not like other men - extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get” (Lk 18:11-12). Though we cannot deny that they indeed performed all these, we know that there is much left to be desired, since the Lord wants us to excel over them. To do so. we must first examine their weaknesses. The first is arrogance, as recorded in the Scripture: “They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the places of honour at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the market places, and being called rabbi by men” (Mt 23:5-7). The arrogance of the Scribes and Pharisees, and their love for self glory are clearly described. Since they desire the glory of men, they will not receive the reward of God. Therefore, we must not be arrogant nor crave for vain glory. Rather let us be girded with humility, serving one another. The things that we have to do, let us do them silently. Let us not boast about our efforts. This is the message behind the Lord Jesus’ saying that we ought not let our left hand know what our right hand is doing. Next is hypocrisy. The Scribes and Pharisees were adept at putting up pretences. They loved to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the street. In doing so, their intention was not that of petition towards God but rather, that they might be seen by men, so as to receive their praises. For instance, although on the surface, they seemed to regard highly the observances of the Sabbath day, they actually did not understand the true significance of keeping the Sabbath. Therefore, the Lord Jesus rebuked them, calling them hypocrites and white washed tombs, which are beautiful outwardly, but are full of dead man’s bones inside (Mt 23:27-28). In whatever we do, our actions must be in accordance with our intentions. The Lord Jesus said, “First cleanse the inside of the cup and of the plate, that the outside also may be clean” (Mt 23:26). This is to teach us that we must first adorn our inner self, before a good image of truth without hypocrisy will naturally appear. We have to learn from the virtues of the Scribes and Pharisees but remain wary of their weaknesses. We have to be alert and keep ourselves in check, performing our duties with sincerity and living our lives befitting true Christians, thus transcending the righteousness of the Pharisees. Obeying the Father’s Will The Lord Jesus once said, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord’ shall enter the kingdom of Heaven , but he who does the will of my Father in Heaven. On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, cast out demons in your name, and done many mighty works in your name?” And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers’ “(Mt 7:21-23). The Lord Jesus will surely come one day. At that time, there will be many who are left outside the gates of Heaven, weeping and gnashing their teeth. Only those who have obeyed the will of God will be allowed to enter and enjoy eternal life. What is the will of the heavenly Father? The Bible teaches, “For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you abstain from unchastity; that each of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honour, not in the passion of lust like heathens who do not know God” (1 Thess 4:3-5). It also says, “See that none of you repay evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you” (1 Thess 5:15,18b). These two passages of Scripture clearly tell us that it is the will of God that we be holy and do good to others. The Scripture also records that one should “strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord” (Heb 12:14). When the Lord Jesus comes again, only those who are holy will be able to meet Him. To be holy is to depart from all unrighteousness, fornication, idolatry, adultery, theft, covetousness, drunkenness, and so on. These are acts that we should not commit. Those who practise them cannot inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor6:9-11). One must also have the full stature of a Christian, allowing no unclean, filthy, foolish talk or coarse jesting to proceed from one’s mouth (Eph 5:3-5). In one’s strife for holiness, one must always pray, relying on the Holy Spirit. The Bible says, “God chose you from the beginning to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth” (2 Thess 2:13’). Striving for the Kingdom The Lord Jesus said, “From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force” (Mt 11:12). In this world, there is nothing that can be gained without any toil. For students to obtain good grades, they must put in effort in their studies. For a farmer to obtain the precious produce of the land, he must work hard at cultivating the land. Though Christians are saved by grace, this does not exempt them from necessary effort. What should believers specifically strive for? Firstly, strive for perfection. The Lord Jesus said, “You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Mt 5:48). This is a reference to the nature of a believer, in terms of his spiritual cultivation in practising the Word. The level of perfection is to be measured against the standard of the Lord. Whatever the disposition of God is, we must also be likewise. This cannot be achieved in a short period of time, but rather through continual striving. Peter says, “For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control... so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (2 Pet 1:5-11). Paul was one who strived for perfection. We normally reckon that for someone who had done so much divine work, salvation seems a natural consequence. But Paul continued to strive with fear and trembling, never relenting. He said, “Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, hut I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me His own” (Phil 3:12). Paul reckoned that only upon the attainment of the life of Christ in his own body, could he be assuredly saved. Therefore he once said, “For to rue to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (Phil 1:2 1). “To die is gain” refers to the laying hold of salvation and entering the kingdom of Heaven . It is quite clear now, that in order to enter the kingdom of Heaven , one must strive to complete the heavenly journey. However, the road heaven-ward is by no means easy; it is long and undulating. The Lord Jesus said, “For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life” (Mt 7:14). The exodus of the people of Israel from Egypt was in order to enter the land of Canaan . After they had crossed the Red Sea , they wandered in the wilderness for forty years. In this long period of time, they underwent desolation, led a monotonous life and endured hardships. Very often, they were intimidated and attacked by enemies. Their experiences prefigure the sufferings a Christian pilgrim would have to undergo. As such, we should persevere and strive to run the race till we reach the final destination. Paul mentioned the Israelites who had faltered and died in the wilderness as an example to encourage believers (1 Cor 10:1-11). We must emulate Paul, as he himself had encouraged us: “Brethren, I do not consider that! have made it my own; but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining froward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (Phil 3:13-14). Paul had run the race with hope, endurance, faith and perseverance. In the end, he had won. He said before passing onto glory, “I have finished the race… Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness” (2 Tim 4:7-8). This is the fruit of perseverance."
1,6469,Is Christmas Biblical?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2012/M23-Is%20Christmas%20Biblical_6469.html,"Is Christmas Biblical? Is Christmas Biblical? Lee Jin [Singapore] Soon the festive season will be here again. Many homes will be decorated with holly wreaths, mistletoe and Christmas trees; departmental stores will be adorned with Christmas lights and echo with the sound of Christmas carols; and post boxes will be filled with greeting cards. Almost universally, shoppers will pack the high streets, gift-hunting for their friends and loved ones. And young children especially, will look forward to receiving gifts from Santa Claus, that benevolent, bigger-than-life father figure who supposedly visits them once a year with his reindeer. What’s the Origin of Christmas? Is It Really the ‘Birthday’ of Christ? Many Christians believe that the Christmas pageant sums up the concept of God and the coming of Christ, the Saviour of humankind. But how valid is this belief? Just take a copy of the Bible. Look for a mention of Santa Claus, holly wreaths, mistletoe and Christmas trees. Look for Jesus or His disciples celebrating Christmas. Look for Jesus’ instruction that we should commemorate the day of His birth. Look for proof that He was born on 25th December. None of these things are mentioned in the Bible! Although the Gospel writers record the nativity story and the events surrounding the Lord’s birth, never once did they indicate that this event should be celebrated. The Lord Jesus told His disciples to remember His death by partaking the Holy Communion, but He was completely silent about remembering His birthday. Likewise, there is no evidence in the New Testament that the early church ever celebrated Christmas. If God had wanted us to celebrate Christ’s birthday, would He not have instructed us to do so in the Bible? The Bible plainly does not reveal the date of Christ’s birth. And from its records of the nativity scene, Jesus would not have been born in winter at all. Luke states that in the night that He was born, “there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night” (Lk2:8). In October or November, the winter rains and cold weather would begin in Judea . Up to this time, the flocks would have been in the open fields. But once the rainy season began, the shepherds could no longer be out in the field until the winter months were over. In fact, the celebration of Christmas originated before Christianity. As the Encyclopedia Britannica informs us, “Christmas customs are an evolution from times that long antedates the Christian period - a descent from seasonal, pagan, religious and national practices, hedged about with legend and tradition” (15th edition, article ‘Christmas’). Some examples of these are given below. In ancient times, many depended on the sun for light, heat and for their agricultural activities. Therefore, man would watch with interest the sun’s yearly course through the heavens. Feasts and celebrations were held at different times of the year to help, it was thought, the sun move round the solar system. In the Northern Hemisphere, the end of the calendar year became a significant time. As winter approached, the sun dipped lower and lower in the sky and the days became shorter. It would seem that the sun was deserting the earth. Then at the winter solstice, the turning point came. The sun began to return. The days began to lengthen again. Midwinter celebrations to commemorate the rebirth of the sun would ensue. In the Roman world, this was translated into the week-long celebration of Saturnalia which started on 17th December and ended with the feast of Brumalia , the birthday, or rebirth of the sun. The feast fell on 25th December. Moreover, when the Roman Empire began to expand in the early centuries, it also adopted the paganistic practices of its conquered people. One such example was the worship of the Mithraic sun god, initially from Persia , whose birthday was celebrated on 25th December. When this deity was introduced to Rome in the beginning of the third century, it gave a concrete expression to sun worship. The cult was reinterpreted according to the philosophical and popular ideas of that time. In 274 A.D., it was incorporated into the imperial cult, when Emperor Aureian made sol invictus (the invincible sun) the imperial religion and instituted the pagan feast of Dies Natalis Solis Invincti , the Day of the Unconquerable Sun, on 25th December. There is no clear historical evidence when Christendom first celebrated Christmas. Records show that during the first three centuries of the Christian era, there was opposition in the churches to the pagan custom of celebrating birthdays. But by the fourth century, things changed. The Roman Almanac -the Chronograph of 354, which contained a list of Christian feasts, made reference to the feast of the nativity of Christ. This is one of the earliest records of this feast. This information goes back to an earlier writing of the year 336 A.D. and therefore Christmas appears to have already been celebrated in the last year of Emperor Constantine. By the end of the fourth century, the Christian world was celebrating Christmas. 25th December was the date chosen for the celebration (with the exception of the Eastern churches, which celebrated it on 6th January). Perhaps the church at that time wanted to turn the pagan celebration of the winter solstice into a day of adoration of Christ. Another possibility is that this was one way for the Christians of that time to cling even closer to Christ who was their light and sun, and 25th December was chosen to provide an antithesis to the Roman pagan feast. Of Christmas Trees, Mistletoe, and Old St. Nick What about Christmas decorations? As expected, they are also not of Christian origin. The famous Christmas tree probably had its origin in the medieval German mystery plays, when a tree, the paradeisbaum (tree of paradise), was used to symbolize the garden of Eden. Later, when these plays were suppressed, trees were kept in the homes, and gradually, there evolved the custom of decorating them with cookies, fruit and eventually, candles. Some authorities have also traced the Christmas tree to pagan tree worship of ancient Egypt and Rome . The use of evergreens to decorate the home is also associated with paganistic beliefs. Because evergreens survive the winter months, they were taken as symbols of eternal life, and became objects of worship. The mistletoe was believed to have miraculous powers by the British Druids (ancient Celts), who considered this parasitic plant sacred. To the Romans, it was a symbol of peace, and they believed that when enemies met under it, weapons would be discarded and truce declared. As for the Christmas holly, one legend claimed that Christ’s crown of thorns was made of holly leaves, and thus the custom of Christmas wreath began. As it was round, it also symbolized the roundness of the sun. Then there is the yule -log , which probably has its origin in the ceremonial burning of a carefully selected log by the British Druids. The word yule originated from the old Anglo-Saxon word hweol , meaning ‘wheel’, a pagan symbol of the sun. And then, of course, there is Santa Claus himself. He too originated from festivals that had nothing to do with the Christian faith. One important feature of the ancient pagan festivities was the involvement of good and bad spirits. In many lands, such mythical visitors emerged, blending pagan legends with traditions about saints, and one such winter visitor became known in different countries as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, St Nicholas, St Martin , the Weihnachtsmann , or Pere Noel . Although they were known by different names, their roles were similar — to give varying degree of rewards and punishments to the celebrants. Over the years, many Christmas customs have developed around the celebrations of Christmas. Some of these are universal, others are peculiar to the region. Irrespective of this, they all share one common feature. None of these is biblical in nature, because Christmas itself is unbiblical. It originated from paganistic beliefs and superstitions, rather than the Word of God, the Bible. As followers of Christ, should we observe an event which is not mentioned in the Bible? Worse, should we celebrate an event which has its roots in paganistic worship? Far from paying homage to the coming of our Saviour, our actions may arouse His wrath instead. Finally, we may want to take the middle ground and argue that we are not treating Christmas as a religious celebration. Rather, we are just celebrating the season of peace and goodwill But, take a closer look at how society celebrates Christmas today. Of all the times in the year, Christmas, to many, is one constant round of partying and merry-making. It is an occasion for overindulgence in food, drinks and even in acts contrary to the words of God. It is also a time when drunkenness is widespread, and where high rates of drunken-driver-induced traffic fatalities have resulted in the police of many countries running annual “Don’t Drink and Drive” campaigns. In many areas, crime rates too are highest during this period. Statistics have shown that there are more murders and burglaries committed around this time than any other comparable period. It is ironic that men participate in the very actions that the Bible warn against during this purported period of peace and goodwill. What basis do we have to say that we are actually celebrating the season of peace and goodwill? This argument for celebrating Christmas is flawed too. Untitled Page"
1,6485,Will Tomorrow Surely Come?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2012/M23-WI_1_6485_6485.html,"Will Tomorrow Surely Come? Will Tomorrow Surely Come? “ All flesh is like grass, And all its glory like The flower of grass. The grass withers And the flower falls” (1 Pet 1:24) LIFE IS SHORT. We all know that. For each moment of our existence, the clock ticks mercilessly. Philosophers and great poets have expounded this universal theme, leaving behind, as they passed through their short lives, clichés in the likes of “Gather ye rose-buds while ye may” and “Seize the day”. Such messages are precisely those which propel man to seek technological innovations so as to be able to do the greatest amount of work possible in the shortest amount of time. Such messages have become the mottos we all cling on to, whether consciously or unconsciously, as we bustle about in worldly pursuits. Most ironically however, while “Seize the day!” rings behind our backs everyday, we seem to assume that life will go on and on, and that there will always be a tomorrow for us again to sing “Seize the day!” The fragility and unpredictability of human life and the imminence of loss of life seldom, if ever, cross our minds. Students study hard so that they have better job prospects, that life will be better tomorrow. Adults slog and toil with the hope of sitting back to enjoy life in the future. Many aspire to achieve greater heights with each day and “all when?” is a question they never bother to answer. As it is, the whole world moves along, apparently seizing the day, yet drunk with the notion that tomorrow will surely come. Along this drunken path, we may be rudely sobered by perhaps, the imminent death of someone we know. Maybe, after a while, we fall back into the drunken state. Maybe, and hopefully, we don’t. Just a few weeks ago, I spoke to a sister in church. I talked about visiting her hometown some time next year. She gave me a smile, her sweet, characteristic smile, and replied, “Next year? Maybe I won’t be at home.” “Where would you be ?“, I asked. “Don’t know, maybe on a tour, somewhere away from home.” I found out what she actually meant only a week later. Doctors had told her the tumour removed from her body was malignant and the cancerous cells were fast multiplying inside her. She is only a teenager. Death—a word we associate with the old, the sick or those in war-torn lands. Normal people don’t talk about death. Strangely, but true, the modern man who espouses “Seize the day” as a way of life, and hence slogs and toils, refuses to acknowledge the fact that for every human being, tomorrow may never come. In Luke Chapter 12, our Lord Jesus spoke a parable about a rich man (Lk 12:16-21). This man typifies the modern man many of us are. He stores up much wealth and plans to build bigger barns for his goods. “Soul,” he says, “you have many goods laid up for many years.” Sadly, he fails to realise that anytime, even “this night”, his soul maybe required of him. For whom has he toiled? How shall he appear before God? If we know we have got 30 or 50 more years to live, we will say many things can wait. Let me earn my first million, after which I’ll settle down and serve God. Let me get promoted as Head of Department first, then I’ll be free to take up divine work. Let my business pickup first...let me... I do not mean these are what Christians should seek if we really have 50 years to go. The point is, these reflect accurately the attitudes many of us have today, which are of course based on the presumption that our tomorrows will surely come. But, how can we know what will happen tomorrow? (ref Jas 4:13-15) This is not to say that Christians must not plan and we should only live from day to day. What is more pertinent is how we ought to lead our lives if we have, say, only one year left to live. If we have only one year more to live, we will probably see ourselves becoming active in divine work. For many of us, serving God in church is something we have always longed to do but which has always been postponed because our secular work needed more immediate attention; and anyway, “we will serve ultimately, not now, but hopefully soon.” We are also more likely to give of ourselves to help others. Someone with 50 years to live has 50 years to lose; he must firmly clasp his dear long life, so he has to do his mental sums and work things out before he decides whether to help. Someone with only one year is more likely to be the good Samaritan to stop and help the wounded passer-by, for probably, he will only pass this way but once. We are certainly more likely to show those whom we love that we love them. We will not want to waste precious time being angry and unforgiving and lock ourselves in emotional cold wars. We will want to reach out to our close ones to tell them about the goodness of our Lord Jesus. We will feel the urgency to seek those who have wandered far from the flock. Meditating on the unpredictability of life and the possibility of death catching us unaware is not morbid. It is in fact essential for Christians. Wise King Solomon says, “Better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for this is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to heart.” (Eccl 7:2) The thought of death can jerk us up, from our complacency, from our numb, zombie-like preoccupation with the world. “The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong...but time and chance happen to them all. For man does not know his time. Like fish which are taken into an evil net, and like birds which are caught in a snare, so the sons of men are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.” (Eccl 9:11 ,12 ). Time and chance are not in our control. So, gather we rosebuds while we may, old time is still a-flying, and this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying—of course, with the right frame of mind, fully focused on God.

1,6508,Haven't Received the Holy Spirit Yet?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M24-HA_1_6508.htm,"Haven’t received the Holy Spirit yet? Haven’t received the Holy Spirit yet? Heather Macdonald (ELGIN/EDINBURGH, UK ) WHEN I FIRST started praying for the Holy Spirit, I really didn’t like the idea of having to go out to the front of the chapel. Being a grown-up, I didn’t want everyone to know that I didn’t have the Holy Spirit. On top of that, I heard about all those members who had to pray for years and years before they received the Spirit. Thank God, I now have the Holy Spirit. Perhaps you’ve been praying for quite a long time and you still have not received the Holy Spirit. But you haven’t given up. Okay, so you feel dejected, but that’s only natural. What I’m trying to say is that I really admire your perseverance. I doubt very much if I would have lasted very long. Perhaps that’s why He gave me His most precious gift so early because He understood. In many ways you’re far stronger than I am. We all know His promise, that He will pour out His Spirit on all who ask, so there is no doubt that He has His intended time for EVERYONE. He is omniscient, He knows our inner hearts; our deepest secrets and innermost fears. He understands our strengths and our weaknesses. He knows how far He can test us. He knows our limit, and tests no one beyond their endurance. God listens to our every prayer, and stores them deep in His heart. He feels what we feel, and listens with understanding, gentleness and compassion to our every need. Assuredly, He knows your every prayer, and understands how you feel when they are not answered; that you feel so alone, perhaps let down, dejected. He wants so much to give His Spirit to you, to pour out His love on you. But He must hold back. God is love. He loves us all, far beyond any human understanding of the word. He knows you are praying, perhaps losing hope. That saddens Him, He wants to comfort you. But His greater purpose must be achieved. It is true that we all receive His Holy Spirit. it is His promise to all those who call upon Him. But we must ask ourselves: why is it that some receive the Holy Spirit so soon? Why do others have to wait so long? God’s ways are truly mysterious and very, very wonderful. We know that He always works for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. I know that it was God’s will that I received the Holy Spirit so soon, just as it is God’s will that you, and many others, must wait. Why is this? Due to our strengths and our weaknesses? May be. He knows us, for He made us. His greater aim must be achieved. He is constantly refining us. Maybe this is your test. it is certainly your blessing. It is during these times of trial, sadness and weakness that God is with us most. He understands at all times how we feel, and because He must refuse our request does not mean He is not there, or that He doesn’t care. It only means that He is waiting with eagerness for us to be ready, when He can pour out His love on us without restraint. The Holy Spirit is the most precious gift His love can offer, and He wants so much to fill everyone. He is constantly watching, waiting eagerly in love for the time when He can grant our requests, fulfill our needs. But the time must be right. It is for us to make this time come. He must see our sincerity and perseverance. It is not too difficult. He understands our weaknesses, and is there constantly to support us; He knows our efforts and that is what counts. He is a God of love, compassion and understanding. In praying for the Holy Spirit, we must have faith, believe that He will give the Holy Spirit to us. Our hearts must be humble and we must be genuinely repentant. Trust in Him, speak with Him, share the depth of your need with him. He is there, just let Him into your heart. He only waits for you to open the door. So please don’t feel ashamed of not having received the Holy Spirit yet. It is especially during this time that God is with you more than ever, reaching out to you, taking care of you and nurturing you. It means He loves you. We must respond. He wants you now."
1,10158,What Should We Worry About?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M11-WH_1_10158.htm,"What should we worry about? What should we worry about? Today people are busy with life and full of worries. In the long journey of life, we are bound to worry for some things. However, many people worry for the things which are not worth worrying and are slow to respond to the things that should demand their attention. As believers of the True Church , what should we be worrying about? The captives When David and his men returned to the city Ziklag, it was found burnt by the Arnalekites. The women and all who were in it, both small and great, were taken captives. All the people fumed at David and wept. David was full of worries and in great distress (1 Sam 30:1-6). When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, from in his house, three hundred and eighteen of them, and went in pursuit of them as far as Dan. He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and routed the enemy. Then he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his goods, and the women and the people (Gen 14:14-16). The two incidents above tell us the worries of David and Abram, and how they went all out to rescue the captives. When we turn to our church and look at our brethren and relatives who have fallen captives to the devil, do we feel anxious and determined to save them? What did the Lord Jesus tell us? He gave an illustration, “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost, until he finds it? I tell you, there will he more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance” (Luke 15:3-7). Paul was chosen to become the Apostle to the Gentiles. The will of the Lord is to send him to save those who are under the power of Satan, to bring them to the light and the True God. As the Scriptures say, “My brethren, if any one among you wanders from the truth and some one bring him hack, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins” (Jas 5:19-20). We should constantly watch over our brethren to see if they are being taken captives by Satan. We must resist the devil by our firm faith and at the same time help those who are weak. Paul said, “To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some (1 Cor 9:22). Those who stumble and fall On one occasion while I watched a women’s 100 meter race, one runner took the lead right outright, and it was quite certain that she would get the gold medal. However, halfway through the race she suffered from leg cramps and fell to the ground. I felt anxious for her. In the end, she lost the gold medal and was taken away by ambulance. When someone stumbles and falls in a race, our spontaneous response is to worry for him. This spontaneous response should also surface when our brethren stumble and fall. Paul said, “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?” (2 Cor 11:29). The brethren in the Lord may stumble for various reasons: 1. Those who stumble because of riches (Prov 11:28). Demas, who was a co-worker of Paul, deserted Paul because of his love for the world (2 Tim 4:l0). Lot moved toward Sodom because he love the world. 2. Those who walk in the night stumble because there is no light to guide them (John 11:10). Many believers continue to indulge in the things of this world and fall to the snares of Satan. They do not see or sense these snares because they walk in darkness. Jesus said, “I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness” (John 8:1 2). Following the Lord guarantees a lighted path. We can hence evade stumbling, for dangers and snares are exposed. 3. Those who stumble because they cannot endure tribulation or persecution (Mark 4:17). There was a brother who had been very active in church work until a sister unintentionally passed some discouraging remarks about him. Later he resigned from his duties and refused to participate in any church work. Later he stopped attending church service and drifted further and further away. I was filled with distress for him and exhorted and encouraged him to come back. He did come hack to church for a period but the sense of injury was never completely healed. To the brethren who stumble and fall, we need to constantly encourage them with the word of God, so that their feeble knees are made firm (Job 4:4). We must also constantly pray for them (Jas 5:13). Through our fervent prayers, the Lord will uphold them. The backsliders The Psalmist said, “My zeal consumes me, because my foes forget thy words (Ps 119:139). When David was chosen, he was persecuted by Saul. Saul was the first Israelite king. In the beginning, he was obedient to God and he did according to what God had instructed him. But later Saul disobeyed God in many matters and when the devil entered him, Saul tried to kill David, At that instant, Saul had completely forgotten the word of God. He did not know how to rely on God and obey Him. In the end he was rejected by God. But David was filled with distress for him, like a burning flame. Although David was tied up by the ropes of a wicked man, he did not forget the law of God and constantly reminded his son Solomon, saying, “Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever” (1 Chr 28:9). The word of God is the lamp of our feet and the light of our path. Without the light, we will be walking in darkness. Walking in darkness makes us fall easily and we become easy victims. The Psalmist says, “If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither! Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy!” (Psalm 137:5-6). And he further asserts, “I will never forget thy precepts: for by them thou hast given me life” (Psalm 119:93). The temple of God David was constantly concerned for the matters of God. He was anxious for the temple of God . He said, “For zeal for thy house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult thee have fallen on me” (Ps 69:9). In fact, his heart was set to build the temple of God. But God did not permit him to do so because David was a warrior who had shed the blood of many (1 Chr 28:2-3).Though unable to fulfill his dreams, he was constantly thinking about the matter and reminded his son Solomon to take heed and be strong and determined to build the temple (1 Chr 28:10). Furthermore, David gave Solomon the plans for all the temple buildings, for the storerooms and all the other rooms, and for the Most Holy Place, where sins are forgiven. He also gave him the plans for all he had in mind for the courtyards and the rooms around them, and for the storerooms for the temple equipment and the gifts dedicated to the Lord (1 Chr 28:11-12). In addition, he also had all the building materials ready and offered the wealth which he had accumulated to the building of the temple. Because of what he did, the people were moved and they followed him in quest to build God’s temple (1 Chron 29:6-9). Today we must emulate the determination of David. We must take positive steps to build churches where there are none. We must not just be concerned with ourselves. The Bible reminded us through the word of the Lord which came to Haggai, “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your panelled houses, while the temple lies in ruins? Now therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider how you have fared. You have sown much, and harvested little: You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes … Because of my house that lies in ruins, while you busy yourselves each with his own house. Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce” (Hag 1:4-10). Let us he moved by the Holy Spirit and revive the work of building Gods temple. There is a need to build more churches to house the congregation. But more importantly, we must build first the temple in our hearts. The Scriptures say, “Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If any one destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him, For God’s temple is holy, and that temple you are” (1 Cor 3:16-17). We must constantly think about our own temple. We must be concerned for any blemish found and remove it immediately so that the Holy Spirit may continue to dwell in it. In one occasion, Jesus went to Jerusalem . In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers at their business. And making a whip of cords, he drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, “Take these things away; you shall not make my Father’s house a house of trade.” His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for thy house will consume me” ( Jn 2:13-17). If our brethren are backsliding, we must quickly bring them back to the fold. We must look after the temple of God , whether it is the physical temple or the spiritual temple of our hearts, so that we will glorify God and edify man. In conclusion, those who are in charge of the church today-- the elders, deacons, preachers and brethren who are strong in faith--should not just be concerned about their own faith and be satisfied that they are saved. They should keep a watchful eye on the weaker brethren and be concerned for those who are taken captives, who stumble and fall or who have forgotten God’s word. They should he concerned also for the temple of God . They should go forth to save, help, exhort, encourage and finish the good work of God through the strength given to them."
1,10788,What Have You Done?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M14-What%20Have%20You%20Done_10788.htm,"What Have You Done? What Have You Done? Solomon in his book of Ecclesiastes concluded that, “For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil” (Eccl 12:14). This serves to remind us that whatever we do we are answerable to God. For the eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good. David in his Psalms said, “O Lord, who shall sojourn in the tent? Who shall dwell on thy holy hill? He who walks blamelessly, and does what is right, and speaks truth from his heart” (Ps 15:1-2). It is understood then that only those who fear God and keep His commandments, do what is right, pure in mouth and minds are qualified to draw near to God. To the Chinese there is a common saying that if you look upwards you have no shame to face God and if you look down­wards you have no remorse to face man. This is their basic principle in life. We, as worshippers of God must lead a life compatible to the gospel of Christ. Our character must be upright before believers so as to bring glory to God. The Bible says, “The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all his innermost parts” (Prov 20:27). The Psalm of Asaph also says, “I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit” (Ps 77:6). Self-examination is a conscience given by God. We must do it often lest the lamp in our heart be extinguished. The Lord God Asked Eve What She Had Done Eve had gone against the commandment of God by eating the forbidden fruits and after that she was afraid to see God. When God called her she replied that she was naked and therefore, she dared not see God. The Lord God asked Eve, “What is this that you have done?” Eve replied that the serpent had beguiled her and she ate (Gen 3:1-13). Because Eve had sinned and in turn had also led Adam to sin. Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sin (Rom 5:12). Eve, tempted by the serpent also because of her own lust. She was not watchful but had given way to Satan. James pointed out, “But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death” (Jas 1:14-15). Actually, when Eve saw the fruit which was beautiful and could be consumed as food she had an urge to eat it and this gave the devil an opportunity to tempt her. When she had taken the fruit and eaten it she also gave it to her husband to eat. God’s commandment is absolute and pure and it will not change but it was a pity that Eve did not look upon it as something important and this had resulted her sinning. The Lord said that His words were Spirit and Life (Jn 6:63). He said again, “If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love” (Jn 15:10). Eve did not keep the commandment of God. She had departed from the love of God. What a pitiful state of affair. God Asked Cain, “What Have You Done?” Man started to kill during the second generation and the one who was killed was the younger brother. After Cain had killed his own brother, God inquired Cain of his brother; to this he said he did not know and he even questioned God, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” But God said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth” (Gen 4:9-12). Will not God inquire of Cain whose hands had killed his own brother? Will God let Cain go unpunished? The killing of Abel by Cain accounts the first bloodshed of mankind. Eversince there happened countless numbers of killings and murders. Therefore, God in His Ten Commandments forbade people from killing each other (Ex 20:13). The Bible teaches us to love one another. One who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen (1 Jn 4:20). The Bible also records, “We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him” (1 Jn 3:14-15). We learn from here that as brothers and sisters we should love one another, and if we hate each other it amounts to killing each other. Jesus said, “You have heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that any one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be liable to hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come offer your gift.” (Mt 5:21-24). Peter said, “Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart” (1 Pet 1:22). So let us not love in words or speech but in deed and in truth, that our hearts may remain peaceful before the Lord. We must truly love one another for love can cover a multitude of sins. Cain had no love for his brother and this led him to the killing of his brother. Samuel Said To Saul, “What Have You Done?” The Israelites were at war with the Philistines. Saul had no patience to wait for Samuel and he offered the burnt offering himself. When finally Samuel arrived and asked Saul, “What have you done?” Apparently, Saul had done something which had violated the commandment of God and this had enraged Samuel to reprove him, “You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which he commanded you; for now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever” (1 Sam 13:8-13). After this incident Saul was still not repentant. Later God had commissioned him to destroy all the Amalekites including their animals but Saul did not do as he was told by God. Saul had compassion on Agag, the Amalekite King and Saul also kept some of the best animals. When questioned by Samuel, Saul replied that the animals that he had kept were for the burnt sacrifice to God. And Samuel said, “Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has also rejected you from being king.” (I Sam 15:22-23). We learn from here that it is important that we should be submissive to God. Saul was disobedient to God and so he was rejected by God and deprived of his kingship and also lost his life. So, let Saul’s downfall serve as a warning to us. Learn the way Jesus had submitted Himself to God. Paul in his epistle to the Phillipians said that, “ though Jesus was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross” (Phil 2:6-8). Indeed, the Lord had received the bitter cup whereby fulfilling the will of the Lord (Mt 26:42). We, too, must carry His yoke and follow His example (Mt 11:29). The Boatmen Asked Jonah, “What Is This That You Have Done!” Jonah, a prophet to Jeroboam II, King of the Israelites (2 Kgs 14:23-27). God sent him to the city of Nineveh to warn the people to repent for this wickedness had come up before God. But Jonah did not obey God’s commands, instead he boarded on a ship intending to escape to a place called Tarshish. However, God had sent a great storm tossing the ship to and fro to a dangerous point causing the ship nearly to capsized . The passengers on board the ship were very frightened, each one calling to his god to save them. When the storm did not stop they resorted to the casting of lots to find out who was the cause of the trouble. The lot fell on Jonah. The boatmen asked Jonah, “What is this that you have done!” Jonah told them unre­servedly how he had tried to escape the commission of God. Finally, Jonah told them to lift him up and throw him into the sea, then the sea will quiet down for them (Jon 1:1-15). It is hard to imagine that a prophet like Jonah could also fail to carry out the will of God. King David in his psalm wrote, “0 Lord, thou hast searched me and known me! Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up; thou discernest my thoughts from afar. Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend to heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in Sheol, thou art there!” (Ps 139:1-3, 7-8). God also makes such remark thought the prophet saying, “Am I a God at hand’, says the Lord, ‘and not a God afar off? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him?’ says the Lord. ‘Do I not fill heaven and earth?’ says the Lord” (Jer 23:23-24). God’s eyes are everywhere. We must submit to His will and not to shirk our responsibility. Jonah had avoided God because of his self-righteousness. He had reasoned with God that what he did was right but according to his own judgment (Jon 4:1-9). Paul in his epistle to the Romans wrote that, “For being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness” (Rom 10:3). So, Jonah’s self-righteousness and his rebellion against God may wel1 serve as a warning to us. Paul said, “Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is” (Eph 5:17). Though the four people men­tioned: Eve, Cain, Saul and Jonah had offered God to different degrees, nevertheless they had committed a common error, ie, they had disregarded the will of God; they had acted on their own will instead of the will of the Lord. They regarded themselves more than God. As disciples of Christ, we must act according to the will of the Lord as Paul did, he said, “If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or we die, we are the Lord’s” (Rom 14:8). The correct interpretation of Paul’s state­ment here is we must obey God unto death, a total sacrifice. Therefore, we must spend more effort in spiritual training so that we may grow up into maturity and we would not be deceived like a small child. When we have equipped ourselves with the truth we shall be able to discern between the good and the bad then slowly we shall attain perfection."
1,10937,Can Christians Believe In Evolution?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M1-CAN_1_10937.htm,"CAN CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION? CAN CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION? One day a small child came home from school. The moment he reached home he asked his mother, “Mama, where did I come from?” Mother answered, “I gave birth to you,” The child asked again, “Where did you come from then?” The mother answered, “My mother gave birth to me.” The child asked again, “Where did your mother come from then ?“ The mother answered again, “Her mother gave birth to her.” Then the child said, “Today, my teacher told me differently. He said that man evolved from monkeys.” Basically, there are only two theories to the origin of all things, i.e., the Theory of Creation and The Theory of Evolution. The basic principle of Creation is based on the first verse of Genesis Chapter I which states, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,” This is a miracle which cannot be explained by scientific methods. Christians have to accept this theory through their faith. There are four basic concepts in Evolution: (1) All species evolved naturally. (2) All species descended from simple organisms to complex forms through millions of years by gradual modifications. (3) In addition to evolution, all species undergo variations. (4) Variations of nature at present can be used as a standard to gauge the changes in the past. Questions which the Evolutionists Find Difficult to Answer There are some facts which evolutionists find hard to explain. Take the example of Geology. Basing on the theory of Evolution this world has gone through many periods, such as ‘glacial epoch’ (ice age) etc., which amount to billions of years. They estimated the history of the earth by studying the structures of the earth: the lowest stratum is the oldest and the upper strata are of latter period. Based on this, there should be vestiges of simple organisms in the lowest stratum. However, facts proved that this theory is not valid, examples: (1) There is neither consistency in the structures of the earth’s strata throughout nor is there any uniformity in its positioning. This is because not all the strata are laid horizontally but some vertically and some slanting with mixtures of clay and rocks. (2) In every stratum is found vestiges of simple and complex organisms mixed together. (3) It was once found in Mount Alpine the fossil of fishes. Fishes are supposed to thrive in water but why were they found on a mountain? (4) In the North Pole, extinct ele­phants were found buried in the ice by some explorers. Some of these elephants still have grasses in their mouths. Their flesh had not decayed. Why should a tropical animal go to the North Pole? The above mentioned discoveries not only stultify the theory of Evolution, they also prove that there was a great change on this earth. When Christians see all these things, they are not astonished, because these things testify to the truth of the great flood as recorded in the Bible. In Genesis Chapter 7 it is recorded: “… all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. ... And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered … And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man; everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. ... And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.” Next lot us talk about Biology. It is stated that on this earth there are over 200,000 species of plants and over 70,000 species of animals. Based on the theory of Evolution, all living things originated from a single cell. After a few million years of evolution, various new species were formed and these finally changed into the many species found at present. However this theory is not convincing. Take the world of bacteria for example: within a few hours, they can give rise to a few generations. Results of research by biologists showed that in the few generations of bacteria there might be some changes in their shapes but no new species is being formed. In 300 B.C., there was a father of medicine in Greek by the name of Hyppocrates. In his book there were already records of bacteria that caused Malaria and Tetanus. Biologists in ancient Egypt also found that there were germs of tuberculosis. As for insects, recently there were people who used flies as objects for their research. They used certain methods to stimulate the propagation of these flies. As a result they found that within the few thousand generations of these flies there were some variations, e.g., the colour, the wings and the shapes etc. But they never found a completely new insect being produced. There were also people who tried various ways of crossbreeding, hoping to produce a new species. For example, to crossbreed the horse and the donkey we will get mule. In plants they used the method of grafting. But the result achieved was only an improvement in quality but never produced a new species. So even until today a horse is still a horse and a dog is still a dog. Further we can ask: “What is the whole business about the ‘Missing Link’ that the theory of Evolution has made that assumption?” For example, if man was changed from the monkey, then definitely there should be the existence of half-man half- monkey, Many evolutionists think that the Peking Man which was found is the Missing Link. But we cannot simply assume that this Peking Man is half-man half-monkey just because his skull was very large. This is because man may be tall or short and may have a large or small head. Furthermore there are abnormal people, Another ‘Missing Link’ is the things between ‘lifeless’ and ‘life’, Another question which evolutionists find it hard to answer is that where all life originated. They may say the simplest organism is the cell. But where did the cell come from? Must Believe That There is an Almighty Creator If we believe there is an Almighty God, then for Him to create heavens and earth in six days is not an unbelievable event. Let us study the order of His creation. According to the records in Genesis Chapter 1, God created: Light on the first day; air on the second day; land, water and plants on the third day; the sun, moon and stars on the fourth day; birds in the sky and fishes in the seas on the fifth day; beasts, insects and man on the sixth. God is indeed an orderly Creator. If God had not first created light, air, land and water, then the plants that were created on the third day could not have multiplied. The creations in the first three days also sustained the lives of man and all animals. When God created the world, He did not create them from existing material (Heb 11: 3). Psalms Chapter 33 states, By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of his mouth … For he spoke and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood forth” (6, 9). This is the mystery of Gods creation and it cannot be fully understood by human reasoning because man’s wisdom is limited. Irrespective of whether they are animals or plants from the day of creation their kinds have been fixed. This is because after the creation, each living creature must be according to its kind (Gen 1: 11, 1 2, 21, 24, 25). If any animal or plant does not follow this simple rule of God, it would face the danger of extinction. For example, a mule cannot give birth to another mule, Hence since the creation, although there may be slight variations in their kinds but the rule that ‘each according to its kind’ as fixed by God shall exist for ever and can never be changed. The Bible has clearly told us that man did not change from another animal but was created in God’s image. Genesis Chapter 1 verse 27 states, ‘So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them,” From the above reasons we know that the theory of Evolution is erroneous, so Christians should not be deceived by it."
1,10938,Does God Exist?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2007/M1-Does%20God%20Exist_10938.htm,"Does God Exist? Does God Exist? • In 1961. when a Russian cosmonaut returned to earth from his trip in space, he made a statement saying that he had already been to heaven’ but he did not see God. Hence, he concluded that God does not exist. A certain evangelist made a comment on his statement and said, “There was an earthworm who one day emerged from the soil. When he looked to his left and right and yet could not see Khruschev (a former Premier of Russia), he said to himself, ‘Surely Khruschev does not exist on this earth!’ • There was a famous doctor who was an atheist and he often gave talks on the non-existence of God. One day, after one of such speeches, he invited the public to challenge him on the topic. However, no one dared to accept his challenge because of his eloquence and knowledge. Seeing that no one came forward, he felt rather proud and happy. Just when he was about to declare the close of his talk, an old village lady carrying a basketful of oranges went up the platform. Everyone, including the doctor, was startled, thinking that this lady was crazy. The old lady began to speak, saying, “I just came back from the market after buying these oranges. When I heard your talk I came in. Your depth in knowledge is highly commendable. So I would like to put forward this question: Are my oranges here sweet or sour? If they are sour, how sour are they, and if they are sweet, how sweet ?“ The doctor replied, “How could I say with certainty when I have not even tasted it?” She, started to peel one of the oranges and eat it in front of the doctor. Then she said, “I’ve now tasted this orange and I know that it is sweet but I cannot describe to you in words just how sweet it is. Similarly I have experienced God in my life because we often have spiritual communication and He often showers blessings upon me. I do not know how to debate but I know that there is God. You haven’t tasted God as you haven’t tasted the orange. So how can you say that there is no God ?“ “O taste and see that the Lord is good!” (Ps 34: 8)."

Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Knowing the true God Sis Lian Yueli, who members of Hualien Church affectionately called “Teacher Lian”, was baptized into the Lord in 1986. She recalled that it was in 1984, when her husband Lee Chengshan who was then a teacher in the Hualien Senior High School was undergoing cancer treatment in Taipei Veterans General Hospital that they came into contact with the members of True Jesus Church’s hospital evangelism team. “Sis Rong visited us frequently and preached the gospel to us. I am still thankful for the love she had shown us years ago.” Despite this, thirty over years of traditional believes has already taken deep root in Mr. Lee. Even though he suffers from severe illness, he still found it difficult to accept the gospel. Upon their return to Hualien, the late Deacon Lee Chenguang and Sister Jiang Zhumei continued the outreach. Teacher Lian said, “Their love and patience were really touching.” Even though her husband refuse to go to church, Teacher Lian was still attracted by the gospel and enjoyed attending church services. In 1986, Mr. Lee suffered a relapse and once again returned to Taipei Veterans General Hospital for treatment. At the time, an Evangelical and Spiritual Convocation were being conducted in Shuanglian church. Both Teacher Lian and her husband went to Shuanglian church to attend service hoping that Mr. Lee’s illness would be cured. At the end of the Spiritual Convocation, both of them received baptism (on May 24, which happens to be Mr. Lee’s birthday). Teacher Lian joyously recounted the miracle witnessed by her husband during the baptism: “During that baptism, I was the first to go into the water. My husband stood nearby and watched. He saw that when the preacher laid hand on me, a light shone down from the sky. When it was his turn for baptism, he witnessed that the baptism water tuned into the color of blood. He was filled with great joy by the vision, because he knew that he was immersed in the precious blood of the Lord.” Mr. Lee was so weak physically prior to his baptism, he had to be supported by a few brothers when he walked into the water. After baptism, miraculously, he looked like a different person. His cheeks became rosy and he was full of vitality. He no longer needed anyone to support him when he walked back to the car. On the ride back to church, Mr. Lee experienced another miracle. At the time no music was being played in the car, but Mr. Lee heard a melody repeated. Upon his return to the church, he hummed the tune to Elder Hou Enyuan. Elder Hou later wrote in the lyrics for the tune – (My Lord Sought for Me) A sheep was missing from the fold The Lord Jesus sought urgently for it Singing praises Hallelujah, He has found me Hallelujah Hallelujah My Lord found me My Lord cares me Singing praises Hallelujah, He saved me Hallelujah Hallelujah When he returned to the hospital, other patients noticed his transformation, and were greatly amazed. Amongst them was a 28 year-old young lady, who came to seek the truth because after witnessing God’s work in Mr. Lee and subsequently baptized into the Lord. God allowed teacher Lain to witness miracles with his own eyes, and after letting his husband experienced the amazing saving grace, God called him back on 23 July 1986 , he was 33 at the time. “When he departed, there was no pain nor suffering. He departed peacefully” teacher Lian recounted. Even though her husband departed at such a young age, when teacher Lian talked about his death, she was calm and serene, as though she was recounting someone else’s story. By God’s immense grace Teacher Lian remain strong after her husband’s he was called by God. She did not wallow in sorrow and sadness for long. Instead, she recovered very quickly and was able to continue to lead her ten-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter in the way of the Lord."

David Jeng—St. Louis, Missouri, USA Recently in my work group we held a special meeting. Another group within our department was having difficulty, and since we were a high performing group, we were asked to rotate several of our engineers over to support their troubled program. Our managers bluntly explained that whoever volunteered to rotate over to that program would likely face overtime and a potentially stressful environment. They were expected to immediately contribute to the program with little or no training. Rumors described a bleak work environment where jaded coworkers toiled under poor management. Repeated failures had further decimated what little morale that remained. The only incentive was that since the department head would have direct oversight of the project, workers would have higher visibility to upper management. Given such dismal terms, I wasn’t expecting anybody to volunteer. To my surprise, those positions were quickly filled. Why would anybody willingly dive into a failed program and subject themselves to high stress and long hours? THE TWO FATES OF WORK Solomon, in his wisdom, spoke about two fates of all who work: a blessing and a curse. A Curse The Preacher reflects, For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity. (Eccl 2:22, 23). We live in a society that has been ruthlessly pushing for greater productivity. Gone are the days where the 40-hour week is viewed as standard. Today, 50 to 60 hours per week is the norm in most industries. Now thanks to our digital leash, we enjoy 24/7 connectivity to the office. We can reply to company emails and work in our virtual office even from the comforts of our home. Only with great reluctance are we able to temporarily suspend our cell phones or Blackberry devices. Even so, we find ourselves fidgeting during that brief duration of our flight. Let us step back for a moment and try to make sense of this work-frenzied phenomenon. Why do we work so hard? Surely we can blame society for at least part of our misery. After all, we are pressured to work overtime in order to survive in this competitive world. Very few of us obey the 40-hour limit or control “when” or “how long” we work. Under these circumstances, work can indeed seem like a curse. Not only does it burden us with stress and fatigue during the day, it also creeps into our nights to rob us of precious sleep. Worse yet, the result of our sweat and blood may simply be a pink slip (or if we own our business, having to declare Chapter 11). A Blessing Fortunately, not all work is doom and gloom. Solomon also writes of the blessing of work. God allows one to “enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him” (Eccl 5:18). It is a “gift of God” and a life of purpose, for “he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps him busy with the joy of his heart” (Eccl 5:19, 20). There are many wonderful ways we can enjoy work. The most basic perk work offers is that it allows us to sustain ourselves. There are mouths to feed and bills to pay. Groceries, rent, and gas, are only some of the basic expenses required of us to survive in this world. Work serves as a means for us to acquire the money needed to provide for our basic necessities in life. For others, work offers more than just money. Our occupation shapes both how others see us and how we see ourselves. Aside from offering an identity and status in society, sometimes it instills a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. Whether they are teachers, scientists, custodians, or waiters, there are people of every profession who are able to look beyond their jobs to see a hope to create a better community, country, or humanity. They share the vision of a better world. HOW TO ACHIEVE A BLESSED CAREER Work is very much a part of our life in this world. When does work become overwork? When does enthusiasm, dedication, and a sense of responsibility become a destructive force that hinders our spiritual, physical, social, and emotional well-being? Let’s examine how God had intended for us to work in this world so that we can turn this curse into a blessing and achieve a blessed career. Reserve Time for Rest Ecclesiastes chapter 3 tells us that there is a time for everything: A time to plant, and a time to pluck what is planted; A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to gain, and a time to lose. In our rush to reach our goals or build up our careers, we may have forgotten that God has also given us a time for rest. It is this rest that is increasingly taken away from us by the changing workplace. There is a fundamental shift in the workplace supporting long and irregular workdays. From free soft drinks and ping-pong tables to more lavish treatments such as free meals and pet care, many companies entice young professionals to work longer hours at the office. Equally significant is the advent of the virtual office in the context of globalization. One may be expected to coordinate time zone differences not only between the West Coast and East Coast, but also that of Bangalore , Moscow , or London . Robbed of continuous blocks of rest, we are forced to rely on short power naps and caffeinated drinks to overcome our bodies’ natural crave for rest. Studies have shown that in addition to a drastic reduction in alertness, 1 sleep deprivation also reduces memory and learning functions. 2 According to sleep researchers, when you get less sleep than what your body naturally needs, you incur a debt that must be repaid. 3 Whether you like it or not, you will repay that sleep. We do need to work enough to earn our daily needs, but there are only so many things we can do in a day before we run out of energy. Rest is essential to our overall well-being. Even though the bulk of our time and energy per day may be sold to the company, we must not forget that life is more than the collection of manna. We need to recognize the importance of rest and allocate time for it. The financial advice for reducing debt, “pay yourself first” applies to rest as well. When we have blocks of free time, we need to set the proper limits and make sure our body gets the rest it needs. Don’t Chase After the Wind King Solomon attained wisdom and understanding unsurpassed by mortals. He amassed great fortunes and a name that lasted throughout history. He constructed great waterways and pools, planted beautiful vineyards, orchards, and gardens, and built magnificent houses. In his lifetime, he achieved many times over what one would be proud to have accomplished in one’s life. But despite all his success, King Solomon’s conclusion was that life without God is meaningless and empty. In other words, no matter how great our accomplishments are in this world, they are meaningless when our lives are not centered on God. In our lives, it is sometimes so easy to lose focus of our purpose. Like Solomon, we may find ourselves unwittingly chasing after the wind. We see others around us toiling endlessly in pursuit of a better life. People then work even harder to maintain that new standard of living. To safeguard against disasters that may take their hard-earned life away, they must work even harder. If we follow their footsteps, we may be like the pitiful rich man who lost his focus in life (Lk 12:16-21). When God blessed him so that the ground in which he labored yielded abundantly, he focused all his time and energy coming up with a plan so that he would retire in luxury. All his toil was in vain when his life ended. Manage Your Investments Wisely When tending to the needs of our faith, family, and career, we are often encouraged to model our priorities after the patriarchs. Whenever Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob moved to a new location, they would always first build an altar to worship God, set up the tents for their family, and finally dig a well to provide for their livestock. While they also faced many daily challenges in confronting the competing demands of life, they were able to find a proper balance. How we manage these three aspects of life is like managing three fields we own—each requiring our labors to till, sow, weed, and harvest. While working hard to invest in your work may yield an abundant harvest of riches and success, this comes at the price of having abandoned fields of overgrown weeds for your family and your faith. The goals we invest the most time and energy in should be tied to the potential returns: the necessities for life, a healthy body, a close-knit network of friends, a loving family, and our salvation in eternity. Just as no amount of money can buy back the love and affection of a child who grew up with an absent parent, no amount of love and affection for our loved ones can give them that inner peace and eternal hope. We must choose carefully how much time we invest working in each field. The most rewarding one, of course, will be that field containing the hidden treasure of eternal life. If we define clear and manageable goals in our faith, family, and career and allot the time and energy to achieve them according to their relative priority, we can reap the abundant harvest of a long-lasting, far-reaching, and much more meaningful existence. Our faith, family, and career are all aspects of our life that need time and care. Like the legs of a tripod, focusing solely on one aspect will lead to an unbalanced life that could easily topple. Invest in the Imperishable When investing, we try to maximize our return on investment. We expect that, at the very least, our returns will surpass the rate of inflation. Similarly, in our career, we expect to receive raises and promotions on a regular basis, but we also seek to maximize our advancement. We work hard and pursue advanced degrees, retrain for certificates, and keep up with the latest technology. We go to conferences or business socials to try to get more visibility with the executives—all in hopes of advancing our careers. In the same way, we should also make goals for our faith and family and hold them to the same level of expectation and ambition as we would in our career or financial goals. Perhaps we can spend a little more time on our health or seek to get in touch with some long neglected friends and family. Or perhaps we aim to build up and train ourselves in specific tasks so that we can work for the Lord. Maybe our goal is to simply advance our spirituality each year. My coworkers were willing to volunteer themselves into such a bleak working environment because they valued the opportunity as a stepping-stone to success. Even though it may cost them time for family, friends, and faith, they were willing to invest in this venture. If others are eager to sacrifice so much for such a tiny hope of greater things to come, shouldn’t we, who possess the precious promise of God, invest heavily in the greatest part of our existence? HEAR THE HIGHER CALLING Mother Theresa dedicated her life to helping others. However, she saw helping orphans as more than just social work—she saw it as a calling from God. We help those around us not just to help others, but most of all to glorify the Lord. As Christians, we too are determined to make a positive difference in the world around us. As the ambassadors of our faith, we have the responsibility to exemplify our faith. However, our mission and calling encompasses and surpasses the vision of simply improving humanity. Even though our job descriptions may seem to be a far cry from the work entrusted by our Lord—to feed His sheep and preach the word of God to the ends of the earth—it is an opportunity given to us by God to do His will. We are placed in our workplaces to illuminate our environments and season those around us. While we exert ourselves in the business of each day, we must ask ourselves: Have we glorified God in our workplace today? 1.

1,11656,Where Are You?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2008/HS10-WHERE%20ARE%20YOU_11656.htm,"ï»¿ WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? âAnd they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, âWhere are you?â (Gen 3:8-9) âWhere are you?â This is the question that God asked when he looked for Adam who had committed sin. When Adam heard Godâs voice, he immediately hid himself, not daring to see God. It is quite possible that before Adam and Eve committed sin, this question was an intimate and gentle inquiry. But after they had committed sin, such question became a frightening and a stern statement. âWhere are you?â to every Christian it is a statement worthy of reflection and examination. Today, if God asked us, âWhere are you?â how would you feel? At this moment, we may be in the midst of the pleasure of sin, or we may be busy in the midst of pursuing a material life. Are we weak and helpless or lost at the crossroad of faith? For a person who truly belongs to God where should he be? I. In Godâs House In a busy life, everyone would hope for a close family filled with joy. Because only such a home is life a harbor to a ship in a turbulent and violent sea. When we are on a journey of faith, we will often be overwhelmed with the waves and the wind. At such time the harbor we can seek is at Godâs home, âwhich is the church of the living Godâ (1 Tim 3:15). At Godâs home, âwhich is the warm concern of brothers and sisters, the heavenly joy, and the closeness surrounds. How wonderful it is to stay in the Lordâs dwelling and how my soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lordâ (Ps 84:1-2). âFor a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wickedness.â (Ps 84:10) II. In the Bosom of God The greatest expectation and hope of a crying baby is to be held immediately in the bosom of the mother and listen to her loving gentle voice. Likewise we should yearn for the pure spiritual milk âlike newborn babies, carve pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation.â (1 Pet 2:2). âHearken to me, O House of Jacob, all the remnant of the House of Israel, who have been borne by me from your birth, carried from the womb; even to your old age I am He, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save.â (Is 46:3-4). This is the given promise of God. III. Before God If children would like to be loved by their parents, they need to communicate with parents constantly and listen and obey the parents in order to be filial. Today, the guidance of Godâs spirit proves that we are the sons of God (Rom 8:14, 16). Since we are Godâs children, we should constantly stand before God. Through the guidance of Holy Spirit in our prayer, each one of us will build up an intimate spiritual relationship with God. When Moses came down from Mt. Sinai he was not aware that his face was radiant because he spoke with the Lord (Ex 34:29-30). Daniel prayed three times per day, communed with God, and received protection from life threatening dangers (Dan 6:10). Therefore, âIf we draw near to God, He will draw near to usâ (James 4:8). By communicating with God constantly, we shall surely see God and be transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory (2 Cor 3:18). We must be righteous so we may see God so when we awake, we will be satisfied with seeing your likeness (Ps 17:15). Ask God for protection and guidance so that when God asks âWhere are you?â, everyone can see God with a clear conscience and say to God, âHere am I. Send me!â (Is 6:8)"

1,11931,What is Most Precious?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2013/SOB3B_8_11931.htm,"What Is Most Precious? What Is Most Precious? The view-points of worldly people and Christians on what is most precious differ greatly. This is because the people in the world generally direct their attention to claims and counterclaims of the world. Their emphasis is on physical dimensions. Perceptive Christians would, however, take God as their central point and place much importance in the everlasting spiritual glory to come. I. The Concept of People in General To some, money is the most precious thing. With money, many problems can be solved and many advantages can be gained. Money can buy the heart's desires. Because of this, people toil, in search of greater prosperity. A wealthy man has much money, acquires and possesses many things. When asked what he has acquired, he produces an unending list. His heart has become occupied by his wealth and he loses his true self and the true meaning to life. When asked what himself is, he is left speeches. Money can buy: food but not appetite; a bed but not sleep; cosmetics but not beauty; material enjoyment but not peace; entertainment but not happiness; women but not love; medicine but not health; a good house but not a good family; flattery but not respect; status but not personality; academic status (degree) but not education; books but not knowledge; a ticket to tour the world but not the ticket into heaven; the world but not spiritual life. To others, the most precious thing is knowledge. With knowledge, under-water tunnels can be designed, men can be sent to other planets, computers to solve complex problems can be invented. To pursue further knowledge and to satisfy the desire for knowledge, sleep and meals are neglected. But the wise Israelite King Solomon said 3,000 years ago: ""I said to myself, 'I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before; and my mind has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.' And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind."" (Eccl 1:16 ,17 ). Knowledge may be able to solve many problems but it can never solve all human problems. Man comes silently to this earth bringing nothing and leaves silently taking nothing (Eccl 5:I5), in his vain life (Eccl 1:2) full of continuous toil and worries (Ps 90:10). He can hardly penetrate into the riddles of life: origin of his birth where death leads to, or the true meaning of life. There are infinitely many questions in life that knowledge alone cannot answer. To others, power is the most precious thing. A person in authority can command others what to do, is respected and advances his reputation. Their aim of existence is to satisfy the desire to hold power, devising many ways to obtain even greater power. Generally speaking, the higher one's status, the greater his power is. The higher one's status and the greater one's power, the more responsibility and mental burden he must bear. Likewise, power brings fame. The greater one's power, the greater his reputation. But fame and authority can cause jealousy among colleagues. Enmity can arise from jealousy and bring forth disaster. The Bible says, ""He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city"" (Prov 16:32). A highly cultivated person who is able to control himself is better than an invincible fighter, because one's greatest enemy is in the heart and not the enemy in battle. Even one with great authority may rule over many but not be able to control his own heart. II. The Concept of Christians For a conscientious Christian, the most precious thing is the Truth. The reasons are: The Lord Jesus said, ""Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life which the son of man will give you. I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall not hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst"" (Jn 6:27, 35). Food which will spoil cannot keep one satisfied. One eats and is satisfied for a while, but grows hungry before the next meal. Likewise, fulfilled desires bring temporary satisfaction and happiness, but will be replaced with more desires. With limited ability, time and strength, satisfaction for unlimited desires cannot be attained. Only the Lord Jesus can grant us eternal satisfaction and true happiness through His spiritual food, the true Gospel which can bring eternal life far exceeding worldly treasure in value (Mt 16:26). Therefore, Moses, in order to obtain the blessings of eternal life, was willing to leave the treasures and enjoyment of the palace (Heb 11:24-26). King David did not admire life in the palace and was satisfied with the future resurrection and life with the Lord together forever (Ps 17:15). In a God-fearing family, each individual, because of the existence of the Truth within, is able to love one another even while leading a simple life. On the contrary, hatred exists in individuals in a family which does not know God, because they do not have the Truth within them. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a fatten ox and hatred with it. (Prov 15:17) The Lord Jesus said, ""Come to Me , all who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest"" (Mt 11:28). 'Heavy laden' with the burdens of one's heart are worries, sorrow, pains and troubles. If we believe in the Lord Jesus as our Savior and accept His Truth, our burdens will be released. The apostles Paul and Silas were, for example, persecuted and severely beaten up by the people for the Lord, but their hearts were filled with joy (Acts 16:16-26). The reason: they believed in the Lord Jesus and had the Truth within them. Solomon pondered upon the afflictions of mankind that he had experienced and perceived and concluded that all was vanity (Eccl 1:2). On this theme he wrote twelve chapters showing that the pursuit of wealth, material enjoyment, knowledge and power could not solve the vanity of human problems. He also pointed out the right way of life, saying, only by fearing God and accepting His Truth and performing it, could it really abolish the feeling of vanity and render meaning to life. Before his conversion, Paul had tried his best to control himself with a determination to forsake evil and turn to good, but because he was bound by the law of sin, he was unable to do the good that he wanted. He said, ""I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do… so I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind"" (Rom 7:14-23). After he was chosen by the Lord Jesus and accepted His salvation, all was changed. Through Jesus Christ, he was delivered (Rom 7:24-25). The Lord's Truth can bring release from the bondage of sin, enabling us to conform to our desires to desert evil, do good, be holy and enjoy freedom in Christ (Jn 8:32; 34, 17:17). At the time of Lord Jesus' birth, the Holy Spirit led Simeon, a pious man in Jerusalem to meet Jesus. This old man praised God saying, ""Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word; for my eyes have seen Your salvation"" (Lk 2:29-30). Any devout person in receiving the gospel of peace (Eph 6:15), which is also the gospel of salvation (Eph 1:13), can enjoy peace and happiness like Simeon. The law of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces. How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth.

1,11961,What Have You Done?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2008/HS15-WHAT%20HAVE%20YOU%20DONE_11961.htm,"""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE King Solomon, in his advises to youths, ""The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person. For God will bring every act to judgement, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil"" ( Ecc 12:13 ,14 ). King David in his psalms tells us, ""O Lord, who may abide in thy tent? Who may dwell on thy holy hill. He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness. And speaks truth in his heart"" (Ps 15:1-2). Even though God accepts sinners, we learn here that only those who fear God, keep His commandments, the righteous and the truthful can be near God. Integrity is important even in the secular world. It goes without saying that as Christians, we should be all the more careful to glorify God in all our deeds and words. ""The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the innermost parts of his being"" ( Prov 20:27). Just as Asaph's psalm says, 'I will remember my song in the night, I will meditate with my heart; and my spirit ponders"" (Ps 77:6), What we fear is if the inner lamp dims. God gives all of us the ability to ""self-examine"" the lamp in our souls. Without this ability, one would be without conscience. We can see that many people in the world today lack this lamp in their souls. Without it, one knows not even to repent. If we do not meditate with our own hearts, how would we respond to others' inquiries? GOD ASKED EVE, ""WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE DONE?"" (Gen 3:1-13) When Eve ate of the forbidden fruit, she was afraid to see God. When God asked her, ""What is this you have done? "", she said, ""The serpent deceived me, and I ate."" Because Eve sinned, sin entered into the world, ""and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned"" (Rom 5:12). Eve's being tempted and deceived grew out of her own personal lusts. She gave a chance to the devil. James suggests that ""each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death"" (James l :14 -15). Actually, Eve had already desired the forbidden fruit when it looked good to eat. She gave a chance to the devil when she lusted with her eyes and desired to eat of it (I Jn 2:16). She reached out to take the fruit because she gave way to lust, and sin was conceived, which brought forth death. God's commandments are absolute, have been tried and will never change. It is a pity that Eve did not regard the Words of God, thereby forfeiting her life. God's Words are ""spirit and are life"" ( Jn 6:63). Jesus also said, ""If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love"" ( Jn 15: 10). Without keeping the commandments of God, Eve's end was eternal isolation from the love of God. THE LORD SAID TO CAIN, ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?"" (Gen 4) In the second generation of mankind, a tragic murder occurred involving two brothers. When Cain killed his brother, Abel, God asked him where his brother was. He gave the infamous reply, ""I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"" God asked, ""What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. When you cultivate the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you; you shall be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth"" (v.9-12). Cain killed his brother. Should God not inquire of it? Could God not punish Cain? The Bible teaches us to love one another; if we do not love the brethren that we can see, how could we love the God that we cannot see? (I Jn 4:20) We also learn that, ""We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him"" (I Jn 3:14-15). Here we learn a hard lesson that we must love one another for to hate is to murder. Jesus also said, "" You have heard that the ancients were told, 'you shall not commit murder' and Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever shall say to his brother, ' Raca ,' shall be guilty before the supreme court ; and whoever shall say, 'You fool, 'shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell. If therefore you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering."" (Mt 5:21-24) Peter said, ""Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart"" (I Pet 1:22). We are to love one another from the heart in sincerity and in our actions, as opposed to only paying lip-service. By loving one another, multitudes of sins are covered. Cain killed his brother because he did not have love, thereby increasing his sins. SAMUEL ASKED SAUL, ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?"" (I Samuel 13) The Israelites were besieged by the great army of the Philistines in a battle. Saul grew impatient while waiting for Samuel, so he offered the burnt offerings to God himself. When Samuel the prophet came, he asked, ""What have you done?"" Because Saul did not obey God's commandments and took it upon himself to do what he thought was right, Samuel rebuked him, ""You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which He commanded you, for now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever (v.8-13). After this battle, came another one against the Amalekites . Saul still did not repent. This time God promised him victory and commanded him to destroy the entire enemy including the spoils in it’s entirely. He not only did not follow God's orders by not killing the enemy's king and by keeping some of the spoils, he had the audacity to tell Samuel that he had saved the choice flock to offer to God as sacrifice. To that, Samuel answered, ""Has the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice. And to heed the fat of rams."" (I Sam 15:22-23). From Saul's case, we learn the importance of keeping God's commandments. Saul lost his reign as king as well as his life. It would do us well to learn from Jesus Christ, who was humble and submitted Himself to God's will in service unto death (Phil 2:6-8). Jesus said, ""Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me "" (Mt 11:29). THE MEN ON THE SHIP ASKED JONAH, ""HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?"" (Jonah) Jonah was a prophet during the reign of King of Israel, Jeroboam II. The time was approximately 793 to 752 BC (II Kings 14:23-27). God wanted him to preach warnings to the Ninevites , but he took off in another direction towards Tarshish (what is now Tarifa of Spain). The ship he was on encountered a raging storm and all the passengers including the captain of the ship were in disarray praying each to their gods for deliverance. A lot was cast and it pointed to Jonah as being the cause. They asked him all sorts of questions including how he could flee from God. Jonah explained what happened and suggested that throwing him overboard would solve the problem of abating the stone (John 1:15). It may be difficult for us to perceive, why as a prophet, Jonah would be so bold as to out-rightly disobey God. David told God, ""O Lord, Thou hast searched me and known me. Thou dost know when I sit down and when I rise up; Thou dost understand my thought from afar Thou dost scrutinize my path and my lying down, And art intimately acquainted with all my ways. ... Where can I go from Thy Spirit? Or where can I flee from Thy presence? If I ascend to heaven, Thou art there; if I make my bed in Sheol , behold, Thou art there"" (Ps 139:1-3 ,7,8 ). God tells us through the prophet Jeremiah, "" Am I a God who is near,' declares the Lord, And not a God far off? Can a man hide himself in hiding places, so I do not see him? declares the Lord. 'Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? declares the Lord"" ( Jer 23:23,24). The sacred eyes of the Lord are everywhere. We must be submissive to our missions whatever they may be and not run away from them. Jonah was self-righteous and thought it reasonable to run away from this particular mission (Jonah 4:1-9). Romans 10 verse 3 says, ""For not knowing about God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God."" What this verse means is that when we do not know what is right, what the will of God is and if we define God's will in our own way, then there is a very good chance that the true will of God gets lost in the shuffle. And nobody wins. CONCLUSIONS ""So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is"" (Eph 5:17). Eve, Cain, Saul, and Jonah all sinned in various degrees, but the four people all made one common mistake -- that is, they disregarded the will of God and went in their own directions. They gave more weight to what they personally felt, understood and desired to do. As Christians, it is expected of us to follow the will of God. ""For if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord. “ (Rom 14:8). That is, total devotion -unto death. If we put more effort on personal cultivation, our spiritual maturity will render the many tricks of Satan as meaningless pranks which have no effect on us. May all Christians grow in God's Truth, be able to discern, and reach God's definition of perfection. Amen."
1,12027,How Much Do You Love Me?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2013/SOB4-_5_12027_12027.htm,"?How much do you love me One day I woke early in the morning to watch the sunrise. Ah, the beauty of God’s creation is beyond description. As I watched, I praised God for His beautiful work. And I sat there, the Lord brought His presence to me. He asked me, “Do you love me?” I answered, “Of course God! You are my Lord and my Savior."" Then He asked, “If you were physically handicapped, would you still love Me ?” I was perplexed. I looked down upon my arms and legs and the rest of my body and wondered how many things I wouldn't be able to do; the things that I took for granted. And I answered, “It would be hard Lord, but I would still love You .” The Lord said, “If you were blind, would you still love My creation?” How could I love something without being able to see it, I wondered. Then I thought of all the blind people in the world and how many of them still loved God and His creation. So I answered, “It’s hard to think of it, but I would still love You .” The Lord then asked me, “If you were deaf, would you still listen to My word?” Again, I asked myself how I could listen to anything being deaf. Then I understood. Listening to God’s word is not merely using our ears, but our hearts. I answered, “It would be tough, but I would still listen to Your word.” The Lord asked again, “If you were mute, would you still praise My name?” How could I praise without a voice? Then it occurred to me, God wants us to sing from our very hearts and souls. It never matters what we sound like. Praising God is not always with a song, but also when we are being persecuted. We give God praise with our words of thanks. So I answered, “Though I could not physically sing, I would still praise Your name.” And the Lord further asked, “Do you really love Me ?” With courage and strong conviction, I answered boldly, “Yes Lord! I love You because You are the one and true God.” I thought I had answered well but God asked, “Why then do you sin?” I answered, “B ecause I am only human. I am not perfect.” “Then why in times of peace do you stray the furthest? Why are your prayers earnest only in times of trouble?” No answer. Only tears. The Lord continued, “Why only sing at fellowships and retreats? Why seek Me only in times of worship? Why ask things so selfishly? Why ask things so unfaithfully?” The tears continued to roll down my cheeks. “Why are you ashamed of Me ? Why are you not spreading the Good News? Why in times of persecution do you cry to others when I offer My shoulder to cry on? Why make excuses when I give you opportunities to serve in My household?” I tried to answer, but there was no answer to give. “You are blessed with life. I made you not to throw this gift away. I have blessed you with talents to serve Me , but you continue to turn away. I have reached out to you with My Word, but you did not gain in knowledge. I have spoken to you, but your ears were closed. I have shown My blessings to you, but your eyes were turned away. I have heard all your prayers, and I have answered them.” “Do you truly love Me ?” I could not answer. How could I? I was too embarrassed. I had no excuse. What could I say to this? When all tears had flowed, I said, “Please forgive me Lord. I am unworthy to be Your child.” The Lord answered. “That is My grace, my child.” I asked, “Why then do You continue to forgive me? Why do you love me so?” The Lord answered. “Because you are my creation, you are My child. I will never abandon you. When you cry, I will have compassion and cry with you. When you laugh with joy, I will laugh with you. When you are down, I will encourage you. When you fall, I will raise you up. When you are tired, I will carry you. I will be with you till the end of days and I will love you forever.” Never had I cried so hard before. How could I have been so cold? How could I have hurt God as I had done? I asked God, “How much do you love me?” And the Lord stretched out His arms as they were nailed to the cross. I bowed down at the feet of Christ my Savior and for the first time, I truly prayed.

1,12386,How is it that You Sought Me?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2008/manna4%2004_12386.htm,"DEATH ?X A CHRISTIAN??S VIEWPOINT When Jesus was twelve years old, his parents, Joseph and Mary, brought him to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover, according to the custom. When the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they sought him among the kinsfolk and acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem , seeking him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.” And he said to them, “How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. ( Lk 2:42—50) Emotions Both Joseph and Mary were devout worshippers of God. Before the birth of Jesus the angel told each of them clearly on separate occasions that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah of the nation of Israel and the Savior of the world (Mt 1:18—25; Lk 1:26—38). In the intervening years before his appearance at the temple their love for the child must have grown very strong. Perhaps their intense parental affection paled even the angelic revelation they had received twelve years ago. Understandably, they became very anxious when they could not find him and they returned to Jerusalem immediately. When they had finally found him, his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.” Had they actually forgotten who Jesus was? They loved him as their very own son. Could they have allowed their emotions to overshadow their realization of God’s will? Let’s apply this to a situation that is altogether common in our day, in our own life. When our children fall sick or are otherwise afflicted, have we not questioned “O God, why have you treated us so?”? Have we forgotten the soothing words of the Bible: That in everything God works for the good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose (Rom 8:28 )? Emotion is a dangerous guide. Countless numbers of young men and women today live to regret the pleasurable moment of weakness when they lost out to their flaming passions. They have not lived according to the will of God. The clamour of their emotions have drowned the soft promptings of God within them. Christians everywhere should therefore pray that they be not overcome by their emotions and allow the will of God to be trampled underfoot. Duty If we examine carefully the reply of Jesus, we can perceive that he was clearly conscious of his status as the Son of God. Aware of the divine task to accomplish the will of God, he replied, “How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” Had they also understood the will of God, they would have been exceedingly happy to him see sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. They would not have said, “Why have you treated us so?” Although Jesus was born of Mary, brought up by Joseph, he had not forgotten that he was the Son of God and that he must stay in the house of God and that he had to complete his mission. In the same way, Moses, who was adopted and brought up by the Pharoah’s daughter and received the best education in the royal court, had not forgotten his Hebrew origin and the commission that God had entrusted to him. When he was forty, he wanted to see his brethren. He refused to be called the son of the Pharoah’s daughter, choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin (Acts 7:20 —23; Heb 11:24 —25). Clearly, to live our lives with purpose and to live victoriously, we must have before us a constant reminder of our duty: to live according to the will of God. My Father’s house We are the children of God. We should always be concerned with the affairs of God. It is unreasonable for children not to be concerned for their parents. Similarly, it is not right for the children of God to have no concern over the house of God. In the time of Prophet Haggai, the Israelites only cared for themselves. They had no concern whatsoever for the house of God. They stayed in panelled houses while the temple of the Lord was left in ruin. Prophet Haggai rebuked them and told them to search themselves. He also told them to bring wood and rebuild the temple that the Lord might take pleasure in it and that the Lord might appear in it in glory (Hag 1:3—8). Are we concerned for the house of God today? We have been pursuing the betterment of our physical life and material gains but neglecting our spiritual advancement. We are so busy with worldly matters that we have no time left to pray or to attend church services. Much less is our interest to do church work. In short, we are living in a state of lukewarmness described in Revelation 3:15—16. At this juncture, it is pertinent to remember the words of Jesus: “How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” Paul could say, “But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.” (Acts 20:24 ) Therefore let the solemn words of Jesus be deeply imprinted in our hearts that we may strive forward with one accord for the faith of the gospel, for the prosperity of God’s true church on earth and for the exaltation of God’s holy name."
1,12388,How Do We Relate to the World's Churches?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2013/M24-There%20is%20One%20Body_12388.htm,"Publication Title SHEE TSE LOONG ( SINGAPORE ) The Christian Church has had a tremendously eventful history since its inception in the upper room at Jerusalem . During this period of close to 2,000 years, the church underwent persecution, growth, official recognition, apostasy, attempted reformation and final restoration. Christianity today, with its fragmented character and denominational diversity, hardly bears any resemblance to the united community of believers that formed the original church. Why is this so? Has the prayer of our Lord ‘that they may all be one’ 1 failed? Or can it be that the Christianity that the world knows today Is not a continuation of the original Christianity initiated by Jesus Christ? We shall investigate. History must be seen from a biblical perspective. Apostasy Foretold JESUS and the apostles predicted the infiltration of false Christs , false prophets, false teachers and false brethren2. Views are divided as to whether there had been a period in history during which the true church was extinct. Some hold that the church could never at any time be uprooted from the world, since the Lord Himself declared that ‘the gates of hell shall not prevail against it’ 3 . They concede at most that the church ‘fled into the wilderness’ 4 at one time. A survey of church history reveals that while there was a long period when the official church was totally corrupt, there were small bands of people who separated themselves, some dwelling in the mountains. These splinter groups, albeit rejecting the frivolities of Rome , were not totally sound in their own doctrines (Box 1). Also, one group differed from another in the effort to return to pure Christianity. Very importantly, none could trace their roots to apostolic Christianity. The visible continuation of apostolic Christianity was, sadly, an apostate church that grew out of European civilization. Severed of all spiritual ties with the church that was founded by Christ, her degeneration and fragmentation were rapid. The gates of hell never prevailed over the unseen spiritual church made up of true believers of all time but the visible true church was nowhere to be found soon after the apostolic era. The Protestant Movement ONE SHOULD NOT be too quick to call the Protestant Movement a ‘church reformation’. In biblical light, the church would fall away from the truth and then be restored by the hand of God 5 . This is analogous to temple rebuilding of which God said to Zerubbabel , “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit.” 6 Since the church had become a political machine controlling the nations of Europe , any movement against it would naturally take a somewhat political course unless divinely inspired. The Protestant Movement, generally ascribed to Martin Luther, could not steer clear of politics. The very name ‘Protestant’ was derived from the formal protest made at Spires in 1529 by the Lutheran princes who ruled over the northern states in Germany , against their Catholic counterparts in the southern states. In 1520, Luther wrote “To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation”, in which he called on the German princes to reform the church by virtue of their office. Luther’s following among the princes greatly helped in furthering his movement but at the same time attracted political response from Rome . Under pressure from these princes, Luther wrote and spoke for armed resistance. Similarly, when the peasants revolted in 1524-25, Luther’s sympathy for them could not persist and he had to favour the princes. In his fearsome tract, “Against the Wandering Thieving Hordes of Peasants”, he asked the princes to ‘knock down, strangle and stab’. As a result, 100,000 peasants died and many left the Lutheran fold. From then, Lutheranism was a religion associated with status and power. It fared no better than Roman Catholicism in that it became a tool for rulers to seize power and wealth. Catholic properties were seized in Protestant German states, and monarchies were formed in Scandinavia . An ordinance of 1537, approved by Luther, made bishops salaried officials of the Danish state. 7 In the same year when Martin Luther presented his Ninety-five theses in Germany (1517), Ulrich Zwingli attacked Roman Catholicism in Switzerland . Five years later, he made a definite break with Rome and established a regime of clergymen and magistrates at Zurich that supervised government, religion and individual morality. The country was divided as a result of this religious conflict, leading to civil wars. Zwingli himself was slain in battle. The movement went onward however, and found its later leader in Jean (John) Calvin, a Frenchman invited to Geneva in 1536. Although faced with initial political problems, Calvin’s party regained power in 1541 and within a short period gained full control of the republic, making his brand of Christianity the official religion. Calvin sought to establish a society subject to religious legislation. A committee of clergy plus twelve lay members known as the Consistory met regularly. With a presiding Magistrate, punishments and ex­communications were passed for law-enforcement. Pastors who sat in the Consistory would visit households without warning to check every detail of private life and impose penalties on offenses like missing church, laughing during services, wearing bright colours , dancing, card-playing, or maintaining some form of Roman Catholicism. Magistrates sometimes used torture to obtain confessions. Execution of heretics was quite common. Calvin managed to get rid by expulsion, and in some cases, torture and execution, those who opposed his earthly set-up of a Christian society. Calvinism spread, like Lutheranism, in other lands, aided by political actions. In France, the 2,000 Huguenot consistories became a civil and military organization as well as a religious one. In 1559, in Scotland , John Knox, a pupil of Calvin, urged the nobility to raise arms against the Catholic administration. By his relentless energy, he swept away every trace of Catholicism and made the Presbyterian Church the established church of Scotland . English Protestantism was even more clearly political. The breach with Rome was led by the king, Henry VIII, not a dissenting priest. Although more than a century before Luther, John Wycliffe had denounced Roman Catholicism on religious grounds and called for reform, Henry VIII now wanted independence purely for private and political reasons. Late medieval kings had often quarreled with popes and national pride had caused resentment of Roman domination. When the pope could not immediately annul his marriage to Queen Catherine, Henry VIII intimidated the clergy into proclaiming him head of the English church. Through the Parliament, he was granted the authority to appoint bishops in England . It was also passed that payments of revenues to Rome should cease and the Anglican Church was established as an independent national organ under the king. By the mid-sixteenth century, there were three varieties of state religion in the west papal Catholicism, state Christianity (Lutheranism and Anglicanism), and Calvinist theocracy. Each was organically linked to the state where it existed and was a compulsory religion; all citizens in a given province were considered members of the state church because they had been christened (made Christians) by infant baptism. Each tried to use all the apparatus of the state as far as possible, to impose a religious monopoly. This led to civil war within and between the European states. The result of the Protestant Movement was not a single, purified, God- restored church, free from the vices of Rome, but many self-governed national churches of various forms - Episcopal in England, Presbyterian in Scotland and in Switzerland, and somewhat mixed in the northern lands. The radical reformers and their followers (e.g. Anabaptists and Puritans), who opposed the official link between church and state, were greatly persecuted by these state churches. Subsequently, each group brought its version of religion into foreign lands through missionary activity. The heterogeneous nature of present-day Christianity is to a great degree, a legacy of the divisiveness brought about by the Protestant Movement. In the matter of doctrine, it was equally divisive from the start. Protestantism, in seeking to depart from the errors of Rome , was never represented by a unified movement held together by a common doctrine. Leaders differed from one another in theological opinions which remain irreconcilable to this day. Referring to the Holy Communion, Luther remarked that he “would rather drink blood with the papists than mere wine with the Zwinglians .” Calvinists thought of Lutherans as virtually unreformed, Romanists masquerading in godly garments. Some Lutherans deemed Calvinist errors worse than those of Roman Catholicism. Both Calvinists and Lutherans condemned the Anabaptists, who in turn viewed the state churches as abominable. Such animosities are evident even in their creeds 8 . Contentions were not merely verbal; the Swiss Brethren for example, faced capital punishment in Zurich , and the Puritans in England were persecuted and imprisoned. The many churches that sprang from the Protestant Movement with their different creeds and doctrines do not fit the biblical description of the ‘one body’ defined by ‘one faith’ and ‘one baptism’ 9 . Also, the political orientation of the movement does not conform to the biblical church, which is a kingdom ‘not of this world’ 10 . Apparently, the restoration of God’s true church by His Spirit did not occur till many centuries after the so-called Reformation. The Tongues Movement CAUTIOUS people in some denominations hesitate to call the Tongues Movement the Pentecostal Movement, and with good reasons. One ought not to link any movement to the biblical downpour of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost before being acquainted with the history, beliefs and practices of that movement. We have seen that attempts at church reform go further back in history than Luther’s time, and we note the same for the Tongues Movement. For as early as the 2nd century, the Montanists were already ‘speaking in tongues’, with their leader Montanus claiming to be the very Paraclete (Comforter). He and several prophets also ‘prophesied’, claiming to deliver inspired messages directly from God. Visions and revelations were also common. We have noted in Box 1 why their beliefs were unsound. ‘Tongues’ also appeared among persecuted Protestants of France in the 17th Century. The Mormons experienced ‘tongues’ in the 1830’s and claimed they could speak the language of the Indians nearest to them. The most notable occurrence of tongues prior to the modern movement is that of the Irvingites in the 1830s (incidentally the same period as the Mormons), not only because it was chronologically the closest, but because among numerous charismatic people today, there is an increasing interest in Edward Irving, its founder, and a growing recognition of him as the forerunner of the Charismatic Movement 12 (Box 2). We now focus on the so-called Pentecostal Movement that started just prior to the turn of the century, before its differentiation into the modern charismatic denominations. Although it became more widespread after the 1906 outburst at 312 Azuza Street in Los Angeles, the Movement actually commenced 20 years earlier in Tennessee, led by a Baptist pastor whose objective was “to restore primitive Christianity and bring about the Union of all denominations” 12 . It later spread to Wales and Los Angeles. The manifestations of the Movement as described in its own records or in books written by its adherents, were quite typical everywhere. Tongues were spoken very loudly, even when the gatherings were small. Sessions were extremely long, often lasting through the night. In exhaustion, many required assistance to stand or to walk. Services had no fixed order, so as to allow the Spirit of God the freedom to lead. In the midst of singing or prayer, someone would spring from his seat and shout at the top of his voice, in tongues or in English. It was not uncommon to see people, including the preacher, suddenly fall flat on their faces and speak for hours in that position. This phenomenon, termed ‘being slain in the spirit’, would sometimes cause one to fall onto a group of people of the opposite sex. Also, people had to be on stand-by to arrange the skirts of women, or to cover them with towels as they lay on the floor. Some would see visions while lying on the floor, shaking. Predictions too, were a prominent feature of the Movement. The principal advocate of Pentecostalism in India , Max Wood Moorhead, claimed that God gave a message through a Swedish missionary on 23 September, 1907, saying that Colombo would suffer an earthquake and Ceylon would be sunk in the sea. He gave a lengthy account of how by tongues and interpretation, the prophecy was confirmed to him on four occasions. The favourite topic of the Second Advent was of course much prophesied about. Many of the prophetic utterances were quite precise, as that the Lord will come “this year” or that “this may be the last winter before He comes”. The movement had on a few occasions admitted that mistakes could occur. As for the Colombo prophecy, a spokesman said, “The Apostles even made mistakes after Pentecost’ ... The Devil’s voice was also heard among the ‘sons of God...’ 13 . The Bible does teach that tongues, visions and prophecies will be restored in the last days 14 . However, the history of the Tongues Movement will cause an objective mind to realise the true church can not have stemmed from it. The Ecumenical Movement and Other Modern Trends THE ECUMENICAL MOVEMENT is one of the most significant Christian developments of the 20th century. Christians, long divided by theological and other denominational differences, have always yearned for unity. In 1948, the World Council of Churches (WCC) was established for this purpose. The message of the Second Assembly of the WCC contained these moving words: “Is your Church seriously considering its relation to other churches in the light of our Lord’s prayer in that we may be sanctified in the truth and that we may all be one? Is your congregation, in fellowship with sister congregations around you, doing all it can do to ensure that your neighbours shall hear the voice of the one Shepherd calling all men into the one flock?” In about two decades, it had already managed to bring into common fellowship over 250 denominations in more than 80 countries committed to “study, witness, serve and advance the common unity”. By that time however, it could be observed that the Council became increasingly involved in issues outside its rightful realm and entered into actions that many Christians found objectionable. It started to launch programs to combat racism, using its funds to back “liberation” movements in Africa and insurrection in the US . Worse, some of the most generously financed groups were avowedly communist and had records of terrorism. In a Reader’s Digest article (October 1971) entitled, “Must Our Churches Finance Revolution?” the question was asked: “Is this what Christ taught?” The World Council had also carried ecumenism too far. In the 1970s, in seeking more togetherness with the communists, it initiated “Marxist-Christian dialogues”. Marxists were allowed to diligently propound their theories in these dialogues, which would cause an observer to question who was converting whom. Another article appeared in the Reader’s Digest in November, 1971, bearing the title: “Which Way the World Council of Churches?” It put forward the question: “Has the ‘ecclesiastical United Nations’ become just another platform from where communism seeks to flay the free world?” On the religious front, the WCC is becoming increasingly friendly with the Vatican . In 1965, a Joint Working Group (JWG) was set up to develop ecumenical collaboration between the WCC and the Roman Catholic Church (RCC). Roman Catholic par­ticipation and membership in regional councils of the WCC has increased worldwide. The WCC invited the RCC to be represented at its 6th Assembly in July 1983 in Vancouver , Canada . Both the RCC and the WCC are very open to inter-religious unity. The 5th Assembly of the WCC began a tradition of inviting guests from other faiths. At the 6th Assembly, this openness to non-Christian faiths was exhibited by the raising of a common pagan symbol, the totem pole. A multi-faith statement in advance of the 7th Assembly 15 advocated a “new paradigm of relationship” among “all religious traditions”. Here are some excerpts: “We have to learn to recognise in our neighbours the presence of the divine spoken of in different ways in different traditions: the Shekhina in the Jewish tradition, the Holy Spirit of the triune God to the Christians, the Atman to the Hindus and Sikhs, the Rub to Muslims.” “In our inter-dependent world, people of one religious tradition alone will not be able to find solutions to the ills of our time.” The 7th Assembly held in Canberra , Australia in 1991 was attended by 15 guests from other faiths. The pluralistic tone was set by scantily-clad aborigines with their tribal dances around an altar. Ecumenism, the concept of ‘one household’, is gradually, but more than subtly, embracing the people together with the elements of other faiths. There are other disturbing trends. A number of theologians and clergymen from almost all the major denominations are now expressing their denial of the fundamental tenets of biblical Christianity, such as the inspiration of the Scriptures, the deity of Christ, the virgin birth and the resurrection of Christ. Accounts of the Fall, the Tower of the Babel , the Flood, are dismissed as myths. More appalling, such remarks are even found in official church organs, statements and educational materials, as well as study aids. The interpreter’s Bible, the Commentary of the RSV Bible says: “From the earliest records of primitive sacrifice man has been obsessed by the efficacy of innocent blood to save from disaster. Both the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches have perpetuated this primitive tradition...there is also an ancient superstition that there is some magic efficacy in the murder of the innocent.” The Layman’s Bible Commentary consistently disparages the historical accuracy of the Scriptures, assigning to them legends, fabrications and prophecies composed after the fact. It also teaches that all men shall be saved whether in Christ or out of Christ. We must not see these recent trends as the beginning of a downward course. They are but a continuation and an aggravation of the apostasy that began soon after the apostolic era. Only in the restored true church where truth is rediscovered, will truth be defended and kept till the Second Coming of Christ. God’s Restoration of His Church THE TRUE JESUS CHURCH believes that she is the true church, restored by God Himself through His Holy Spirit. It should be clear by now that this article does not reckon that the movements hitherto mentioned were God-appointed forerunners in the similitude of John the Baptist, paving the way for the emergence of the true church. We do seek unity, but we do not believe that we can be ‘one body’ without being of ‘one faith’. We cannot unite with any individual or body that does not stand on the apostolic teaching’ 6 restored to us by God. We therefore reject the notion: “Love unites, but truth divides”. Truth unites. It is false doctrine that causes disunity, for all who are called to be one must be sanctified with truth 17 . We are also not bigotted separatists. Though we do not align ourselves with the denominational churches, or claim a share in their historical heritage, it is unjust for us to discredit the labours of their forebears. The Protestant Movement has brought to us benefits that cannot be overlooked. The Bible, that had been for years accessible only to the clergy, was made available to the common folk. In the days when the death penalty was imposed for illegal possession of the Scriptures, the sacred writings were mass printed and circulated. The ecclesiastical ban also did not deter Luther and Calvin from translating the Bible into the common tongues of their people. Of particular importance to the English speaking world is the great work of John Wydliffe who first translated the New Testament in English and subsequently with the help of a few friends, the Old Testament. Today, the Bible, in whole or in part, has been rendered into thousands of languages, all undertaken by people outside our fold. The important question we need to answer is: How do we relate to the world’s churches? The question is in fact two fold : Firstly, how do we view them, and secondly, how should we treat them? The answer to the first is not too difficult. We have already seen that they do no correspond to John the Baptist. However, the assistance they have rendered to us makes them comparable to King Cyrus -not of the stock of Israel , but called the Lord’s ‘annointed” 8 . In this sense, we see God’s hand working through the Bible translators. And we know that God has worked and still does work, through any person or event as it pleases Him, since He had even worked through a donkey’ 9 . This is in line with our conviction that in everything God works for our good, for we are His true children who are called according to His purpose 20 . The way we should treat the world’s churches is well defined in this statement: The possessors of the truth owe the greatest debt of love. We owe it to the whole world, but especially the professed Christians, to preach the true gospel to them. We need to have the enthusiasm of Aquila and Priscilla in expounding the full gospel to those who have an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of it. The extreme love of Paul for his kinsmen has to be replicated in each of us. Our hearts should go out to them, despite their misunderstanding or persecution. The truth of God is essentially the gospel of His love in dying for sinners, and so we who are called to be valiant for truth must be ambassadors of love. Box 1 As the post-apostolic church became plagued with heresy and as church organisation become more imitative of the imperial government of Rome , a puritanical group, led by Montanus of Phrygia in Asia Minor , sought to return to the simplicity of primitive Christians. They believed in the priesthood of all true believers. Tertullian (160-220 AD), one of the very respected early church fathers, embraced their views and wrote in their defence . There are questionable teachings among the Montanists , which include that Montanus and a few others, including women, were a continuation of the inspired mouthpieces of the Holy Spirit, after the manner of the apostles, and that the new Jerusalem would literally ‘come down out of heaven from God’ and that it would be fixed in Phrygia. During the medieval times, about 1170, a group emerged in southern France , known as the Albigenses , so called because Albi was an important centre . This group, also known as the Cathan (“Pure”) repudiated the authority of church tradition, circulated the New Testament, and opposed the Romish doctrines of purgatory, image-worship and priestly claims. They were however, dualists, believing that there are two eternal powers, the one good and the other evil, that the visible world is the creation of the evil power, and that the spiritual world is the work of the good power. As a result, they endeavoured to shun all that had to do with reproduction of animal life. They saw marriage as perpetuating the human species in this sinful world. Those who had fully embraced their way of life were called Perfecti (“Perfect”) and must become celibate and vegetarian. The rest were called Credenti (“Believers”) who would work towards becoming part of the ‘perfect’ before their death. Another aberration was their view of many parts of the Old Testament as of the Devil. A contemporary group, the Waldensees ( Waldensians ) was founded by Peter Waldo, a merchant of Lyons who went to a theologian to ask the way to heaven and received the reply: “If thou wilt be perfect go sell that thou hast, and give to the poor”. He proceeded with this injunction by giving his wealth to charity, and founded a lay order of evangelists, the Poor Men of Lyons, who went about preaching two by two, simply clad, barefoot or wearing sandals, taking no purse, subsisting on what was given by their listeners. However, they still practised the hearing of confessions, though holding that a layman was as competent as a priest to do so. Many of their views were extreme; for example, they taught that every lie is a deadly sin and that accumulation of wealth is evil. Box 2 Edward Irving was a Presbyterian minister of the Church of Scotland, who served in London from 1822 till his death in 1834. In 1824 he was influenced by a man named Hatley Frere to view that the prophetic books of Daniel and Revelation indicated that the coming of Christ would be just a few years away. The following year, he wrote that there would soon be an “outpouring of the Holy Spirit” attested by “signs and wonders”. His view that the charismatic gifts would be restored during the Millennium was later modified under the influence of A J Scott, a ministerial probationer in Scotland . He came to believe that the gifts were never withdrawn, but that the church lost them only because of coldness of heart. As such they were as much available as they had been in the apostolic days. Tongues soon broke out in Scotland (1830) under the influence of Scott. Delegates from London visited these tongue speakers and upon returning started to speak in tongues themselves. By the beginning of September 1831, a considerable number of people in Irving ’s church were speaking in tongues. Some could interpret tongues while others could prophesy in English, purportedly giving inspired messages directly from God. The messages however, were simple truths and lacking in substance, which any person with a fair knowledge of the Christian faith could compose. Six persons in this company were known as “the gifted ones” and sat together in a prominent pew during services. Though they were designated specific periods in the service to exercise their gifts, they soon disregarded the limits and interrupted the services with their exhibition of tongues and prophesying. Others in the congregation soon did the same and Sunday services were often disrupted by tongues, sometimes with sudden shrieks, hissing or groaning. Other gifts soon developed within the charismatic faction of the church. One Robert Baxter, a lawyer, was deemed to have received “the gift of knowledge”. He offered to answer “in the power” any questions that might be put to him. He also began to “preach in the Spirit” and made predictions. For example, he set the date of Christ’s return as June 27, 1835 which was accepted by Irving himself. He instructed his minister brother to baptise his six-week-old daughter “with the Holy Ghost” so that she could speak in the Spirit. Worse still, he was told by revelation to leave his wife. There were other prophets whose declarations “in the power often contradicted one another. Tongues at that time were thought of as actual foreign languages. As such, it was deemed unnecessary for missionaries to learn foreign languages and some sought tongues in order to participate in missionary work. Human inducements were commonly used to get people to speak. Often, seekers were instructed to “yield their tongues” to the Spirit. Before long, the features hitherto mentioned caused some to doubt and eventually abandon their charismatic views. Amongst them were strong advocates like A J Scott, Robert Baxter and one of the “gifted ones”, Miss Hall. But Irving held firm to his conviction till his death. He had, besides those mentioned, other peculiar beliefs. He saw sickness as either punishment from God or attack from Satan and opposed the use of medicine. He also held that Christ possessed the fallen nature though He “did no sin”. He told his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who denied the deity of Christ, that he had learned more about true Christianity from him than all other men he met.

1,12390,Will Those Who Are Saved Be Few?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2008/LW1981%20SAVED%20BE%20FEW_12390.htm,"WILL THOSE WHO ARE SAVED BE FEW? WILL THOSE WHO ARE SAVED BE FEW? Jacobus Dion One day someone asked Jesus Christ, ""Lord, will those who are saved be few?"" Jesus did not give a direct answer. Instead he made an important remark for our contemplation: ""Strive to enter the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the householder has risen up and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and to knock the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us.' He will answer you, 'I do not know where you came from""' ( Lk 13:23-25). It is not for us to speculate on the number of people who are saved, but we must first clarify the concept of ""being saved,"" and also who will be among those who are saved. Salvation does not take place at the moment when a person feels convicted, or determines to become a Christian by confessing the Lord Jesus Christ as personal Savior and Master. Repentance is not a ""born again"" experience in the Biblical sense. Mere verbal acknowledgment and belief in the heart (Rom 10:9) is only part of the general truth for acquisition of salvation. The Lord Jesus and the apostles have prescribed the necessary steps for salvation: To see and enter the kingdom of God, one must believe, repent, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, receive the Holy Spirit, and keep the commandments of God ( Jn 3:5, Acts 2:38, Tit 3:5, Mt 7:21-23). In so doing, the person is able to prevail over sin in this life, and he, as an obedient child of God, will be delivered to the kingdom of heaven for eternal life (2 Tim 4:18). From the time of creation Satan has harbored distaste for the people to receive the knowledge of the truth. He maliciously put the world to paganism and spiritual darkness. In Christendom he misguides the people to a very easy and broad way: the evil heart of unbelief (Hebrew 3:12), deviation from the apostolic message (1 Tim 4:1,2 Cor 11:4, Gal 1:6-9) or spiritual ignorance, poverty, and nakedness (Rev 3:14-17). What one must be concerned about the question of salvation is this: Can you be admitted to the narrow door and receive the eternal salvation? The Lord Jesus' warning deserves our careful consideration. If the householder (i.e. the Heavenly Father) shuts the door, can you get a chance and be admitted (cf. Mt 25:1-12)? Will you be among those worthy few who are born again from water and the Spirit, worship God in spirit and truth, and keep the word of God? Will you be willing to be not only called but also chosen by the Lord Jesus?"

1,12459,Are We Responding to God's Refinement?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2013/SOB5-_2_12459.htm,"Are We Responding to God's Refinement? Are We Responding to God's Refinement? REFINING is a process whereby something is improved in quality and purity. Like gold, we, the believers of Jesus Christ, have to be refined to purge our impurities. As Peter succinctly puts it,”....... though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold which though perishable is tested by fire, may be found to praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (I Pet 1:6-7). He highlights the function of trials which come in various forms such as misfortunes, confusion, sufferings and persecutions in life, so that our faith in God is made genuine and established through refinement. Our Heavenly path begins, continues and ends with faith. ""That is why it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his (Abraham's) descendants (Rom 4:16). Abraham, our father of faith, responded to God's call without hesitation, left his country, kindred and father's house, not knowing where he was to go (Heb 11:8). That was because he had faith in God's words: “I will make you a great nation, I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves"" (Gen12:2-3). God who called Abraham, also called us out of darkness into His marvelous light (I Pet 2:9; Acts 26:18). In his faith journey, Abraham was further refined by God. His belief in God's promise to give him a son was reckoned to him as righteousness (Gen 15:6). The highest form of refinement came when God commanded him to sacrifice his son Isaac (Gen 22:2). In this dramatic account of God's test of Abraham's obedience, it was the final refinement test of his faith in God's word. He believed fully in God that Isaac would be the heir of his promise (Gen 17:19). No one else would come forth from Abraham to receive the same covenant from God. It was to be Isaac through whom Abraham was to gain numerous descendants. Indeed, God desires those who follow Him to truly believe in Him. We believe in Jesus Christ and that God can raise the dead and transform the living when He comes again. Sometimes, He brings upon us blessings in disguise and trials. Trials for refinement which we have not experienced before push us to the limits of human imagination and into the purest of faith to call upon God (2 Tim 2:22). A pure heart where there is no doubt in what God has done through Jesus Christ, no doubt in what He is doing through the Spirit of Christ in His believers, and no doubt in what He will do in the future. However, in this world, there are more downs than ups in our lives. We could be worn beyond our ability to bear the unexpected adversities in our heavenly journey. These can manifest in unrest or rift in the family; financial constraint at home, work trepidation and pressure from the boss and stress from studies. Job was stripped of everything he owned, lost all his children in a single day, afflicted with boils all over the body. The highest refinement point was reached when Job still held on to his faith in God in times of calamities. His faith was indeed refined as pure gold. Our genuine spirituality is only revealed in times of sufferings and tribulation. Our faith is only tried and refined when we know how to reach out to Jesus in circumstances beyond our own ability to bear. According to His will, through tragedies, He brings us closer to Him. Thus, we have to respond to each trial positively. We can then say, ""The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord (Job 1:21). Hence, in times when we feel most distressed, we take it as strength to push us forward and yearn for the best that lies ahead. With faith, we are reassured that He will not let anything happen without a purpose. Faith is believing every single word that is written in the Bible about what God is, what he has done, is doing, and will do for His saints. No wonder James tells us to count it all joy when we fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of our faith produces patience, making us perfect and complete (Jas 1:2-3). God’s refinement also comes upon us because He wants us to turn back to Him. We can be led astray by the false spirits. The Israelites rebelled against God repeatedly both in the wilderness and in the land of Canaan . God disciplined them with severe punishment because He loved them and yet they would not return to Him. We therefore must respond to his refinement in order to receive His heavenly reward. In times of hardship, sufferings or tribulation, let us submit to Him wholeheartedly, examine ourselves and turn back to Him. Remember, God's arrangement is always wonderful and has a purpose, which we can easily overlook. Whether He refines us or betters our faith in Him, may all praises be unto His Holy Name, Jesus Christ. Amen! Untitled Page"
1,12468,Do You Still Hold Fast to Your Integrity?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2013/DO%20YOU%20STILL%20HOLD%20FAST%20YOUR%20INTEGRITY_12468.htm,"DO YOU STILL HOLD FAST YOUR INTEGRITY? DO YOU STILL HOLD FAST YOUR INTEGRITY? A probing question is derived from three Bible readings. Money, reputation and the lust of the flesh can easily cause one to lose his belief. If his faith is not strong enough, he is easy prey for Satan. The wily one will exploit any situation to cause him to fall, using what people generally like best, riches and glory, as bait for the unsuspecting Christian. Consider then these snares that Satan put to the following three men and their responses. Put yourself in their place and ask, “Could I still hold fast my integrity?” I. Jesus Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me”. Then Jesus said to him, “ Begone Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve”. (Mt 4:8-10) Have we been offered bribes in our business ventures? Do we continue to pursue worldly gains instead of worshipping God? Satan may not appear to you directly as he did to Jesus, but often uses his surrogates to offer something that will take you away from God. That is not all he does. To some he offers bait, from some he takes all. Consider the second man. II. Job (Job 1 and 2) The Lord blessed Job, an upright, God-fearing person so that he became a wealthy man. One day Satan said to God that he wanted to test Job’s up­rightness and integrity in fearing God. Satan destroyed Job’s property, live­stock and even his ten children. Faced with this calamity, Job said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” Not satisfied, Satan struck Job again, lie afflicted Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. Job took potsherd to scrape himself , and sat among the ashes. His wife said to him, “ Do you still hold fast your integrity’? Curse God, and die”. But he answered, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin in his lips (Job 2:7-10). The story of Job remains one of the most remarkable insights into human integrity in the face of adversity. Job lost his property, his children, his wife and his health, but he did not lose his integrity. He retained this very fibre of the human soul and thus survived physically, mentally and spiritually (The story has a happy ending. See Job Ch. 42). If possessions are everything to us, the loss of them will mean the loss of everything we live for, and it is easy to answer the question of Job’s wife. See what Jesus has to say: “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS, THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO.” (Mt 6:19-21 Emphasis added) III. Paul Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one - I am talking like a madman with far greater labours , far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. Five times I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been adrift at sea; on frequent journeys, in danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brethren; in toil and in hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. And apart from other things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches (2 Cor 11:23-28). Satan knows that much glory awaits the faithful Christian at the End. He tries to turn the Christian from this objective by employing a gilded substitute in the form of temporary, immediate glory. A Christian who pursues true spiritual glory will find his integrity in working for God sorely tested when he encounters difficulties. Moreover, he knows that for the same effort, he can obtain much more from the world. The lure often proves too much. Paul’s example is worthy of emulation. In his work for God, he displayed as impeccable standard of integrity, hurdling obstacles as they came. Can we still hold fast our integrity? Examine yourselves, to see whether you are holding to your faith. Test yourselves (2 Cor 13:5). Untitled Page"
1,12469,"My Child, Did You Hurt Yourself?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2013/My%20Child%20Did%20You%20Hurt%20Yourself_12469.htm,"My Child, Did You Hurt Yourself? My Child, Did You Hurt Yourself? An Israeli folk-tale reads like this: There once lived a widower with only one daughter. Though they were very poor, they lived happily together. The father loved his daughter very much, and his daughter would say, ‘My father is the one that I love most in the world”. One day this girl fell in love with a man. She loved him deeply and told him, “You are the one I love most in the world.” The man did not believe her and told her to remove her father’s heart to prove her love for him. The girl considered this matter for a long time. One night, she took a knife and plunged it into her father’s chest. She took out his heart and ran as fast as she could to offer it to her lover. In her haste, the girl tripped and fell in the darkness. Her father’s heart cried out immediately, ‘My child, are you hurt?” She realised that she had done wrong and began to cry bitterly. I could not but marvel at the greatness and gentleness of this father’s love for his daughter when I reached this part. Even when his daughter had been so unfaithful, he remained loving and caring. How many of us today resemble this girl? “I would never plunge a knife into my father’s chest and take out his heart!” you may say, but instead of making hasty statements, let us consider the case of a typical Christian and see if we fit his mold. When a man has just believed in Jesus Christ, he is elated and seeks baptism. At his baptism, he cries, “Oh, I love you, God! Oh, I love you, Jesus!” Months, then years pass. Many things begin to take the place of God in his daily life — education, career, family, money…. Church attendance slackens; he does not pray as often and offers very little to God; he may resort to unscrupulous means to achieve his ends. But, this is not surprising since he has lost his first love — God. The girl in the folk-tale removed her father’s heart. This is gruesome enough, but consider what the Bible says about the atrocities we commit against our Father in heaven: Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me. But you say, ‘How are we robbing thee?’ In your tithes and offering (Mal 3:8). We increase His burden on Calvary ’s cross: Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many (Heb 9:28 ). Every sin that we commit has to be accounted for. When we ask God for forgiveness, our sins are ascribed to Jesus on the cross. His burden was enormous because of the many sins men have committed through the generations. Isn’t it a shame, that as enlightened children of God, we add to His burden each time we sin? Some crucify Him a second time: They then commit apostasy (and therefore) they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold Him up to contempt (Heb 6:6). Except for the last of the above sins, God is willing to forgive us of our offenses against Him. We rarely remember that He is looking on sadly with a heart pierced by our misdeeds. He grieves when our conscience, darkened by sin, causes us to stumble and hurt ourselves spiritually. Troubles, failures and illness stalk us. Yet it is at this time that He speaks to us gently, “My child, are you hurt?” He offers to lift us up and anoint us with wine and oil. Though we often hurt deeply the heart of our heavenly Father, He still says, “I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn you.” (Jeremiah 31:3) Strangely, some refuse His hand offered to them in their difficulty but those who repent and turn from their sins can find comfort in God’s love. He will not always chide; neither will He keep His anger forever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. (Psalm 103:9-10). We end with a prayer to our God. Oh Lord, how deep Your love is. We pray that we will all be touched by Your love and to love You all the more. Oh Lord! We are not worthy to plead to You. But because of Your love, You have overlooked our sins and have counted us worthy. Though we can never repay You fully, we pray that we can reciprocate Your love for us, at least by not hurting You through the things we do. Help us to love You more, forevermore. Amen.

1,12491,"Was the ""Big Bang"" Really God?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2011/Was%20the%20big%20bang%20really%20God_12491.htm,"Was the ""Big Bang"" Really God? Was the ""Big Bang"" Really God? W. C. Liu For centuries, unbelieving scientists have rejected and ridiculed the biblical version of the creation of the universe.  They have attempted to prove that the creation theory, indeed even the Bible itself, is nothing but a legend with no scientific foundation and no means of verification.  They have during the past centuries developed their own theories about the formation for the universe.  Unfortunately, none of the theories they have constructed is able to satisfy scientists in the various fields of scientific investigation. However, scientists, based upon Einstein's theory of general relativity, have developed a theory called ""Big Bang"" which is currently gaining increasing popularity. Since the early part of this century, scientists have been working their way backward to the moment of the creation of the universe.  By the 1940's they had come to within three minutes of the titanic explosion that took place nearly 15 trillion years ago.  By 1970 they had pushed the boundaries of knowledge to within about one millisecond of the ""Big Bang."" Today they have come even closer - to an interval so short that our concept of time itself may have to be redefined before we go any farther.  Scientists from various disciplines have conducted successful experiments to support the ""Big Bang"" theory.  So far it seems that no one has proved it to be erroneous. According to the ""Big Bang"" theory, there was a tremendous cosmic explosion some 15 to 20 billion years ago. (1) After this inconceivable explosion the cosmic cloud and dust resulting from it spread, and is still expanding outward at an astonishing speed.  On its way of expansion it condensed to form 10 billion galaxies, each one a group of hundreds of billions of stars, including our own solar system which is believed to be formed some five billion years ago.  The sun was formed by nuclear fusion to produce light for the satellite planets, including the earth.  Thus all matter and space itself came into existence. By accepting the ""Big Bang"" theory scientists are 'satisfied' that the question of how the universe was created is answered.  However, they are now deeply troubled by another question, namely, ""what existed before the Big Bang?"" To this question Edward Tivnan in Newsweek Focus summarized the general feeling as follows: It came as a shock in the scientific camp when Einstein's theory of general relativity led to what is now accepted as the most likely scenario (for the beginning of the universe): the 'Big Bang,' a cosmic explosion in which the universe was born just short of 20 billion years ago.  Suddenly, the newest story of Genesis looked suspiciously like the oldest: a single, flashing act of creation.  Fiat Lux (L. let there be light).  Most astronomers and physicists took the news badly.  Einstein himself found the Possibility ‘irritating’..... Whether it's called God or not, scientists are increasingly accepting the idea that what came before the big bang may be unknowable.(2) Therefore, ""most cosmologists - scientists who study the structure and evolution of the universe - agree that the biblical account of creation in imagining initial void, may be uncannily close to the truth.""(3) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the water.  And God said, "" let there he light,"" and there was light. (Gen 1:1-3) No matter how science advances, human wisdom and intelligence are limited.  For example, in time we simply do not know what it means by no beginning, and in space, by no end.  But in the Bible there are several places that teach us that God is the one who has no beginning and no end ( Prov 8:22-23, Jn 17:5, Heb 7:3, Rev 21:6, 22:13). It is likely that in time when enough mystery is revealed to man, everybody, including the unbelieving scientists will agree that the ultimate truth of the creation of the universe of anything else is in the Word of God - the Holy Bible.

1,12652,"Jeremiah, What do you see?",https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2008/SOB6-_5_12652.htm,"Jeremiah, What Do You See ? Jeremiah, What Do You See ? ""Jeremiah, what do you see?"" ( Jer 1:11 ,12 ). Historically, Jeremiah's ministry spans the period of time between the reign of Josiah, ca. 626 BC ( Jer 1:2) and the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC ( Jer 52; 2Kgs 24:18-25:30). In the years before 598 BC Jeremiah prophesied doom and destruction against Judah ( eg . ch 6). He warned that the Lord would punish them because of their apostasy, disobedience (7:21-26), complacency (5:11-17), oppression (5:25-29), injustice (8:10), pride (13:9), and especially adultery. All had sinned greatly, from the people, to the priests, to the prophets, to the king (5:1-5, 30, 31 ). The first chapter of Jeremiah shows how God's decision to destroy the rebellious nation is irrevocable. Another prophet, Amos, had already been sent to proclaim the imminent destruction to Israel . In a vision (Amos 8:1-2) he saw a basket of fruit (Hebrew qais ), which in fact represents the end of the nation (Hebrew qes , meaning the end). Now Jeremiah receives a similar visionary truth, that Judah , like her sister nation, Israel , will soon confront God's righteous judgment. In reply to the divine interlocution, Jeremiah says that he sees an almond staff. In a word play, God goes beyond the natural image of almond (Hebrew shaqed ) and expounds the meaning of the prophetic vision as an absolute divine sovereignty in human history. God is watching (Hebrew shoqed ) His will being carried out. In this instance, Jeremiah sees only a part, a natural object, the almond rod, but God gives a more dynamic and profound dimension of meaning. To man's limited vision there is always an omniscient divine perspective. And so a substantive shaqed is now turned to the divine action shoqed . A natural object which is seen in the confines of space and time has now become a sweeping historical development. This divine transformation proves that the Lord is not only a just God but also the author and arbiter of human destiny. It will be of interest for us to look into the divine dialogue with Jeremiah in the vision of the almond rod. Almond is known to be one of the early blooming, trees in the spring. In the Bible the rod is a stem of a growing plant ( Eze 19:11-14), a soldier's weapon (1 Sam 14:27, 43), a king's scepter (Ps 110:2), or the wonder-working rods of Moses and Aaron (Ex 4:7 ,8 ; Num 17). It is used by the shepherd to marshal and count his sheep (Lev 27:32, Mic 7:14) or defend his flock (Ps 23:4), but it is usually taken to be a scourge (I Cor 4:21), an instrument of punishment. Assyria is, for instance, the rod of the Lord's anger (Is 10:5). In Jeremiah's vision, chastisement is intended for the people of Judah at this critical historical moment. The coupling of the image of the scouring rod with that of an almond tree implies that the destruction of Judah is coming soon. The imminent divine retribution through the agent, the army of the enemy is further confirmed by the vision of the boiling pot in 1:13 ,14 . The tribes of the east come to invade Palestine from the north like the downpour of the unbearable, seething, boiling pot. The vision of Jeremiah teaches us several things. First we learn of the limited vision of man and the discrepancies between the divine and human perspectives. God may reveal to us something profound through an everyday event or natural object, but we fail to grasp the transcendental meaning of His overall purposes. As stated in the Bible, God's thoughts are not human thoughts and are always higher than human supposition, just as the heavens are higher than the earth (Is 5S:8, 9). Joseph's story serves as an example of how the higher divine will works good for those who love Him. By human judgment, it would be inconceivable that Joseph should be first betrayed by his own brothers and then falsely accused by the wife of his master. Imprisoned, Joseph interprets through his God-given wisdom the dreams of his two fellow prisoners. But Joseph is forgotten and must suffer for another period of time. It seems unfair, but God again has His higher purpose. Not until Joseph interprets the dreams of Pharaoh and suggests how to overcome the coming years of famine is he promoted to a noble status in Egypt . With his position, Joseph is able to deliver his family from famine and make possible an eventual family reunion. His words of consolation to his brothers are attuned to the overall divine purpose: ""Fear not, for am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me: but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. So do not fear: I will provide for you and your little ones"" (Gen 50:19-21). And so God's covenantal promise in Genesis 15 also comes to fulfillment: Abraham's descendants would go down to Egypt , to be followed by the Exodus and re-entry into Canaan . In order to illustrate the inscrutability of the divine perspective, let us see Jesus' description of Himself in John 3:13. After a conversation with Nicodemus focusing on the need for everyone to be reborn from water and the Spirit as prerequisites to the entry into the kingdom of God , Jesus reveals His own divine origin and omnipresence. He states that He comes from above and remains above while on earth, and that His Resurrection-Ascension has already come to pass. The historical Son of man has been recognized as a Jew ( Jn 4:9), or a son of the carpenter (Mk 6:3). However, the mystery of the Godhead is thus: as the Son of God (in the Gospel of John) or the Son of man (in the synoptic Gospels), Jesus must obey and do the will of the Heavenly Father and glorify Him ( Php 2:6-9; Jn 4:34; 5:19; 8:29,54; 9:4). But Jesus is the Incarnated Word and the full embodiment of the invisible God ( Jn 1:18; Col 1:l5; Heb 1:3). The Name of Jesus is the name of the Father ( Jn 17:6, 11, 26; 12:28; Mt 28:19 = Acts 2:38; 4:12; 10:43; 11:47-48; 19:2-7), also the name of the Holy Spirit which is none other than the Spirit of Christ (Rom 8:9; I Pet 1:11), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), or the Spirit of the Son (Gal 4:6,7). God is not limited by time and space, and cannot be measured by physical dimensions, and so He can be simultaneously on earth as well as in heaven (Mt 3:16). Jesus, who is one with the Heavenly Father ( Jn 10:30), declares that those who see and know Him have seen and known the Heavenly Father ( Jn 14:9; 8:19). For this reason, we must see the Lord Jesus Christ not only in His sonship (High Priesthood or the Mediator), but also in His divine origin and eternal power as God Himself. Another enlightening incident in Jesus' ministry warrants our deep reflections. This is the sending of the seventy to fulfill their task as harvesters: Israel is ripe for the sickle and must be gathered into the garner of the kingdom while the season lasts ( Lk 10:17-20). When the missionaries enjoy their success as exorcists, Jesus reveals a more far-reaching vision. He points out a primordial past when the fallen angels were cast out and became the legions of the evil force ( cf symbolic portrait of the fallen angels in Eze 28:12-17; Is 14:12-15). Meanwhile, Jesus points to the ever-present spiritual struggle between light and darkness, and as described in Revelation, the Devil and its kingdom will finally be thrown in the lake of fire (Rev 20:7-l5). The victory over evil and death comes from the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ (Heb 2:14, 15). And so from this one event, the Lord Jesus Christ has taught us how His divine vista stretches from the present to the past, and to the future. While the disciples rejoice at their dominion over the evil force, Jesus Christ calls their attention to something more important and more rewarding: their names are to be recorded in Heaven. The value of one's life does not lie in the power to exercise miracles, but in the ultimate salvation. Jesus shows a higher view than the ordinary person's and shows a way to discern the difference between what is the priority and what is of less importance, what is substance and what is phenomenon. Miracles pertain only to this world. It can solve the physical problems but not salvation of the souls. Moreover, the special spiritual gifts in performing wonders and healing can be abused for personal gratification, causing those lacking spiritual discernment to fall away from the grace of God. Jesus Christ wants His disciples to spread the gospel of the Kingdom with the support of the divine power (Mk 16:15-20; Rom 15:8, 9; Heb 2:3, 4), but they must watch and pray and not stray from eternal life ( Lk 21:36). It is necessary for the believers to fix their sights on the permanent, heavenly blessing that the Lord wants to grant us. Now let us imagine what we would answer to the divine question, ""My child, what do you see?"" Is our vision a limited one, or a broad one which is able to relate our own thought and deed to the divine precepts? The Lord wants us to have a farsightedness about the development of church ministry and how we the workers of God plan, coordinate, and execute the tasks wholeheartedly and effectively for His glory. In our daily life, are we able to see things in their ""wholeness, symmetry, whatness ?"" Are we able to have more creative imagination and transformational vision is the spheres of art, while having a more analytical faculty in scientific thinking and discovery? Do we see how great the effect of a genuine faith is, as exemplified by the men of faith in the history of the chosen people (Hebrews 11)? A correct view of life determines a person's course of action. A perceptive person will give up things of this transient world for things of spiritual magnitude. Moses, for example, forsook wealth, position and the enjoyment of this life to become a worthy vessel of God. The Bible describes that he chose to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin, and that he considered abuse suffered for Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked to the reward from above (Heb 11:2S, 26). Let us examine ourselves. We ought to see how God requires us to be holy and to offer an acceptable spiritual worship and spiritual sacrifice (I Thes 4:3; Rom 12:1, 2). In our service of the Lord we must learn from the Lord's parable of two men praying in the temple. The Pharisee falls short of the glory of God, because while thinking only about his own ritualistic conformity, he judges the tax collector. However, the Lord reckons the tax collector as righteous, because he prays for the forgiveness. Here and now the Lord wants to see that the worship of God conducted in the spirit and the truth ( Jn 4:23-24). lie treasures humility, sincerity, and mercy more highly than the routine worship or regular offering: He has shown to you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God? ( Mic 6:8) ""Because thy steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise thee"" (Ps 63:3). Life would be meaningless if God should forsake us; we would have nothing to live for, no one to comfort us, no one to rely on. With His love we are assured of peace and support; this is worth treasuring! In return, we should always praise Him and glorify Him. This would be the least we could do to repay His precious love.

1,12802,Are You Ready To Die?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2008/THE%20LOR1_12802.htm,"ARE YOU READY TO DIE? ARE YOU READY TO DIE? I. Moira Shek , Elgin , UK “…and he died instantly…” These unforgettable words come over the phone one day last summer. A friend of mine was killed in a terrible accident. The question “Why?” was the first thing that came to mind after the initial shock wore off. He was only twenty something, he was my brother in Christ and my friend. He was full of life and energy. Recently graduated from university ,, he had just begun a new chapter in life, which he had barely just tasted. He had so many plans. Little did he know that he was going to die so soon. None of us expected it too. Through faith, I understand and accept that God grants us life and thus has the full right and authority to take it away. Nonetheless, I still found the shocking news difficult to accept and comprehend and the same question “Why?” continued to linger in my mind. I should and do, however, take great comfort in the fact that he is enjoying and tranquil life than once could ever imagine. Praise the Lord! “Man’s life is short.’ How many times have we heard that? These words only took effect on me when my friend’s life ended so suddenly. Life is like the sound of a bell, whose resonance reaches its listeners for a moment and is heard no more. Despite the gradual increase in health awareness and the advancement of medical knowledge and technology, none can live forever. The law of nature determines that where there is life, there will be also be death. Death is a certainty that no one can prevent from happening, although the actual time is happens is uncertain. Furthermore, death knows no barriers and is not prejudicial. It does not just visit the old and the sick as is the common perception. Before the sudden death of my friend, the thought of dying never entered my mind. Even if it did, it was quickly dismissed. But thinking about it now, what would happen if God decided to take his breath back from me today or tomorrow. Am I confident enough to say that I am ready for Him and that I will be able to live eternally with Him/ Have I lived a life worthy of a child of God? Have I done enough for God? Or more to the point, what have I don’t for God? How many times have I put God to one side and left Him there until I had a use for Him or needed Him ? How many times have I been spiritually charged after attending church convocations, youth meetings and theological seminars but failed to maintain this high level of intensity in my faith after I leave each spiritual oasis? Does my renewed spiritual energy slowly deplete, unnoticed and unused? How many times have I procrastinated about drawing nearer to God because I am too wrapped up with myself and my life and am not quite willing to cut off or even loosen the ties I have with this world? How many times have I, moved by god’s love and spirit, been determined to become a new persona and to love God sincerely with all my heart, only to lose this motivation and drive when I encountered obstacles and succumbed to temptations? How many times have I pondered over and found excuses when asked to attend bible studies and church services, but readily accepted invitations to the cinema or to dinner? Embarrassingly, these times have been all too many. When we are enjoying life and everything is hunk-dory, we may develop a complacent attitude towards life, and more importantly towards the church and towards God. When this spiritual apathy becomes apparent to us, is it vital that we take the necessary steps to change for the better. Realization is the first step. Taking action to resolve our spiritual inertia is the key. Two skydivers, both wearing parachutes, jump from a plane at 15,000 feet in the air. One of the skydivers ignores the ripcord of his parachute and says to himself “I’m perfectly safe because of my parachute” and still with this ignorant though in mind, he is killed as he hits the ground at 100 mph. The other skydivers know that just wearing the parachute will not save him. He must physically do something to avoid the fate of the other skydiver, so he pulls the ripcord of the parachute and lands safely. If we know we have to make a stronger commitment to God, we should take steps to do it while we still have a chance, whether it is to resolve to work more for God or to modify our priorities in life. If we are aware of our spiritual apathy, we should do something about it. We know too well; “time waits for no man”. What if we gain the whole world, yet realize too late, that we have forfeited our soul? No compensations in this world is as valuable as our eternal life. Nothing could ever replace its loss Jesus once related a parable about a certain landowner. (Luke 12:16-21) This man was very rich, astute and intelligent, but Jesus called him a fool. Why? The reason was that this rich man misunderstood the meaning of life and what it took to fulfill it. He had laid up many goods for himself for many years to come but then God told him that he was going to die that very night. What use are riches to the dead? He was a fool because he was so busy gathering his treasures in the material world that he did not think to lay up treasures in the material world that he did not think to lay up treasure in heaven. He failed to comprehend that his spiritual needs could not be satisfied through material means. The pursuit of money, prosperity and prestige had occupied his mind and time. How many of us today are just as foolish as him? It is necessary to work in order to take care of our physical needs, but the purpose of living itself calls us to go further than this – to fulfill our spiritual needs. The fate of this rich fool should constantly remind us that what we perceive as being of great value may in fact be ultimately meaningless. The only riches that will retain its value and not depreciate with time are those that we invest in our eternal inheritance. These riches are only gained through fearing God, obeying his commandments and testifying for Him. But how many of us look that far ahead? We are constantly reminded through the news how death does not give any warning. Consequently, “life should not be taken for granted” – how many times have we heard that adage? Unfortunately, many of us do take life for granted. Day after day we expect tomorrow to bring the start of another brand new day to be filled with work, rest, play and more memories. But what if tomorrow doesn’t come to us? Have we ever seriously thought about it? Sometimes certain events like the sudden death of a young friend serves as a sharp reminder of how a diversity may strike as any time and how fragile life really is. We should devote our lives to what really matters and not waste time striving after worldly success, prosperity and pleasure. These are understandable pursuits for those who do not know God. Believers, however, have to pursue goals that are everlasting and pleasing to God. King Solomon, the man with unprecedented wisdom and wealth, wrote Ecclesiastes not only to warn future generation (including us today) that the pursuit of wealth, power and excessive pleasure was a “striving after wind”. He also wanted to spare them the pain of learning for themselves that without God life is meaningless. Solomon had everything a man could desire but when he concluded that ever-thing was vanity because all men will eventually die (Eccl 9:2-3) , he had to search for true satisfaction elsewhere. The aged Solomon then took a reflective look at his life and ultimately concluded that the true meaning of life was simply to “fear God and keep his commandments” (Eccl 12:13 ). Everything else was vanity and a ‘striving after wind”. He advised that even if we were to lose everything in the world, we still have God who is all we really need. No one knows for certain how many years God has granted to each one of us. What is certain is that one day we will pass away. Paul’s philosophy of life was simple: “if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord.” Paul constantly wrote in his epistles how he did not fear death, how he considered his life and his possessions as refuse and how he longed to be with God. “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (Phil 1:21 ). But he knew that God has a purpose for him in this world. As long as God’s breath of life was in him, he had to preach and to fight the good fight. He endeavored to imitate Jesus and urged others to follow his example. (1 Cor 9:16 -17) After his conversion on the road to Damascus , Paul understood the true meaning of his life. He was motivated to honor and glorify his Savior through boldly preaching him. For the present, as we wait, we should live life judiciously and constantly examine and control the direction our life. We simply cannot afford to become complacent. If we find ourselves stuck in the doldrums, swift action needs to be taken. Thankfully, we are still living in a period of grace, but for how much longer? Bearing in mind that tomorrow is promised to no one, we should regard each new day as a gift from God and give thanks to Him. We should consider the advice of King Solomon and Apostle Paul and resolve to live and devote each day for our Lord – to fear, to obey, to glorify and to serve Him until the day we die or the day our Lord returns. Only then will we be living a meaningful life both beneficial and satisfying to ourselves but most importantly, acceptable to God. Many people shudder at the mention of the word death. In fact, many people fear death because they fear the unknown and what will happen to them beyond life, as they know it. From a Christian’s perspective, death should not be geared but embraced because the day has come when our Lord Jesus will gather us in His gentle arms and carry us into His heavenly kingdom. There is our final home, which our Lord has lovingly prepared for us, to live a new life free from toil and suffering. ( Jn 14:1-3). It is a world where tears are replaced with laughter, sorrow with joy, chaos with tranquility, war with peace, and hate with unconditional love. Although death ends our physical life on this earth, it is also the beginning of our eternal life with God in heaven. Everyone will eventually die, that is a fact. The question is ‘ARE YOU READY’?"
1,13495,Is it Acceptable to Date an Unbeliever?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2009/lm_us_hnolmantia_dateunbeliever_6_13495.htm,"Is it Acceptable to Date an Unbeliever? Is it Acceptable to Date an Unbeliever? At a recent church seminar, thirty-two youths were asked to anonymously write down on a piece of paper their answer to these questions: 1) Do you believe it is OK to marry a Christian from a different church? 2) Do you believe it is OK to date a Christian from a different church? Here is a summary of their responses: Do you believe it is OK to marry a Christian from a different church? 25 No 78% 1 Not Sure 3% 6 Yes 19% Do you believe it is OK to date a Christian from a different church? 19 No 59% 3 Not Sure 9% 10 Yes 31% Although a majority of the youths surveyed believed one should not marry outside of the church, about one-fifth of the youths do not share this same conviction. When it came to the question of dating, only a small majority of 59% believed it improper to date someone from a different church. It is interesting to note that more sisters than brothers (70% vs. 50%) believed we should only date inside the church. This was a small and informal survey, but it validated my perception that many young people are confused about what constitutes a proper relationship with those who have not been baptized in our church. Let’s say a dear brother (or sister) in Christ confided in you that he really likes someone at work or school. He believes this may be the person of his dreams, except there is one huge problem—she is not a member of our church. Torn between his desire to serve God with a clear conscience and his attraction to this person, he asks for your trusted council. How should you guide him? This is a sensitive topic as it not only speaks to delicate matters of the heart but also forces us to delve uncomfortably deeper into personal convictions about faith and the Truth. It is a complicated matter within the larger context of a diverse church body and an important issue that requires discussion. The intent of this article is to candidly present biblical teachings to help guide young people in making relationship decisions that will always honor God. HOW DID PEOPLE “DATE” IN BIBLICAL TIMES? If we search the Scriptures, we will not find the command, “Thou Shalt not Date an Unbeliever.” In fact, the Bible does not talk about “dating” at all, because dating and courtship were viewed differently than in modern times. The people of the Bible did not entertain the idea of having a trial and error period in their lives, where one could enter into casual relationships before finally committing oneself to matrimony. Such “loose” behavior would be shunned by the community at large, and persons conducting themselves in that way would be branded as promiscuous. It was more typical that a young man who esteemed a young woman would discuss the matter with his parents, who in turn would approach the family of the young woman. If there was acceptance, the two were betrothed or publicly contracted to soon enter into the solemn and sacred rite of marriage. And not a few of these unions were in fact pre-arranged before the young man and young woman even met—a thought inconceivable in today’s day and age! Although the central topic here is dating, we cannot have a meaningful discussion about dating apart from marriage, because the goal of all dating and courtship activities is to be married. FIVE BIBLE PRINCIPLES ON MARRIAGE Although the Bible does not offer direct references to dating, it does provide a clear definition and direction on what constitutes a proper sexual and marital relationship, which we can employ to guide our actions. Here are five biblical principles that are worthy of review: 1) Sexual activity outside of God’s prescription of marriage constitutes sexual immorality and is a serious offense Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge. (Heb 13:4) Now the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. (1 Cor 6:13b) Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s. (1 Cor 6:18-20) From these verses we understand that the only circumstance in which the bed is undefiled is within the sacred union of marriage. Any sexual thought or deed outside of God’s marital parameters would constitute porneia (the Greek root from which we get “pornography”), which is translated “fornication” or “sexual immorality” in the English Bible. This is a serious sin against the most Holy God and the body of His temple, for which the Bible forewarns no such practicing person shall inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor 6:9, 10). Hence, the seventh commandment, “You shall not commit adultery,” can be better applied as “You shall not fornicate or commit sexual immorality” to encompass all sexual sins, including adultery, premarital sex, rape, incest, homosexuality, and even bestiality. In today’s sexually charged environment, we see billboards, magazines, movies, television shows, music videos, and video games that glorify sexual immorality to such extremes that entire societies have become desensitized and debased from prolonged exposure. But we know that all these things are an abomination to God, regardless of how callously it is promoted by our culture. In any dating or courting relationship, inside of the church or not, we must honor God and refrain from such activities that the Bible permits only married people to do. 2) God’s prescription of marriage is that we are to marry only in the Lord A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord . (1 Cor 7:39, emphasis mine) Do we have no right to take along a believing wife , as do also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas ? (1 Cor 9:5, emphasis mine) These verses provide additional emphasis to keeping marriage “in the family” of believers. The widow can take another husband, but she is restricted to marry in the Lord. The apostles are at liberty to take along a wife, but not just any woman—she must be a believer. “Because God said so,” should be reason enough for our faithful obedience, but the Bible also provides the following compelling explanations for why God strictly prohibits mixed marriages and demands our separation from unbelievers. 3) In God’s eyes, unbelievers are mentally, physically, spiritually, and ritually unclean. Becoming “one” with an unclean person will not only defile our body but also God’s church and temple of the Holy Spirit. This is what I often hear from brothers and sisters who are considering relationships outside of the church: “She’s a devout Christian, just in another church, and she has better moral virtues than many other people in our church…” “I’m thirty years old now. I’ve tried but can’t find any brothers in church…” “Well, he’s really nice to me and respects my parents…” “Maybe after a while, she will come to believe too…” The problem with each of these statements, and most discussion circles about dating and marriage, is that we are starting from the wrong place—that is, we are looking at a spiritual matter from a human point of view. Whenever we start talking about feelings, emotions, and other complicated human dynamics, we are speaking from a human perspective. If we really want to know God’s will, we do not need to look further than the Scriptures. It’s all about cleanliness. Here are some crystal clear passages that command God’s clean people to be separate from the unclean people of the world: “The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their impurity. Now therefore, do not give your daughters as wives for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons; and never seek their peace or prosperity.” (Ezra 9:11, 12) Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” Therefore “Come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord. “Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you.” (2 Cor 6:14-17) [S]o we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. (Rom 12:5) Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Certainly not! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? For “The two,” He says, “shall become one flesh.” But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him. (1 Cor 6:15-17) So we see, with respect to the sacred rite of marriage, God’s primary concern is not “chemistry” or “character” but “cleanliness.” It really does not matter if this person is a devout and chaste Christian. Until he or she receives the one true baptism, this person is still unclean in God’s eyes. 4) Having a spouse that serves other gods will cause us to fall away from serving the one true God “Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son. For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; so the anger of the Lord will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly.” (Deut 7:3, 4) But King Solomon loved many foreign women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh: women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites , Sidonians , and Hittites from the nations of whom the Lord had said to the children of Israel, “You shall not intermarry with them, nor they with you. For surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods.” Solomon clung to these in love. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. For it was so, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not loyal to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David. (1 Kgs 11:1-4) Are we wiser and mightier than Solomon? Marriage is the most intimate relationship on earth, and our spouse will no doubt have the most profound influence on our spiritual growth or downfall. 5) Mixed marriages hinder our ability to raise godly children, which is an important function of marriage and the responsibility of parents But did He not make them one, having a remnant of the Spirit? And why one? He seeks godly offspring. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth. (Mal 2:15) In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon , and Moab. And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people. So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves. Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things?” Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin. Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women? ( Neh 13:23-27) This marital decision is not just about us and what we want for our lives. When our spouse does not esteem the Lord, it impacts our ability to bring up the child whom God had entrusted us to raise in a God-fearing manner. So we come to this understanding—that it is not a trivial matter, but a great evil and abomination in God’s eyes, that the people He had sanctified and for whom He made such sacrifice should again defile themselves with the unclean peoples of the world in sexual immorality, mixed marriages, and rearing children that do not honor God. The Bible teaches in unambiguous terms that, as children of God, having been sanctified by the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should remain separate from the unclean and unsanctified. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, which dwells in us, and we are not to defile this holy temple by committing sexual immorality in uniting with an unbeliever, Gentile, pagan, or unclean person. IS DATING AN UNBELIEVER SIN? Now that we have completed our review of the sanctity of marriage, let us return to the original question—is it morally acceptable to date an unbeliever? If we have completely followed through the logic—that dating results in deeper mutual feelings, which is the typical precursor to marriage, and that marriage to a Gentile is unacceptable in God’s eyes—then we must all agree that it would not be wise to start weaving this complicated web. We often think about sexual immorality as the physical act of adultery or fornication, but our Lord Jesus explains that the sinful deed begins in our heart, “For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies” (Mt 15:19). Consider the commandment prohibiting adultery. Jesus said that “whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart ” (Mt 5:28, emphasis mine). The Greek word for lust is epithumeo , meaning to have a strong longing for or desire for something. It is sin to lust for that which God has already forbidden, even within the private confines of our heart. For example, God has forbidden adultery; therefore it is sin to lust after your neighbor’s spouse. God has forbidden incest, so it is sin to have sexual thoughts about one’s own sibling. God has forbidden homosexual activity, so it is sin to have romantic feelings for someone of the same sex. These are all examples of sins that have not been physically acted out but still defile our heart. And let us remember the Apostle James’s warning that if these lustful thoughts are left to fester, they will lead to more regrettable actions and unfortunate consequences. Recall the tragic stories of David and Bathsheba, and of Amnon and Tamar. Consider how the narratives would have changed if David had turned away after seeing Bathsheba bathing or if Amnon had immediately repented of his impure thoughts for his sister. We finally arrive at this central point—it is sin to desire and date an unbeliever, as it is sin to desire someone of the same sex, another person’s spouse, or your close relative. It is sin on the simple basis that God has forbidden it, and if we have learned any lesson from Adam and Eve, we ought not to long for what God has already explicitly forbidden. Let us instead keep our faith simple and minds pure and no longer entertain the idea of having a romantic relationship outside of the body of Christ. DEALING WITH TEMPTATION Why did God put a luscious fruit tree in the Garden of Eden and then tell Adam and Eve not to eat of it? And why was God so cruel, bringing this attractive person to me and then restricting our interaction? James writes plainly that God does not tempt anyone (Jas 1:13). Apostle John reiterates, “For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life— is not of the Father but is of the world” (1 Jn 2:16, emphasis mine). All temptations come from the tempter himself, Satan. He uses these choice weapons of lust because they are effective in enticing humans to sin, which, if left unchecked, will accomplish Satan’s goal of our spiritual death. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. (Jas 1:14, 15) Carefully guard the heart—do not let any impure thoughts linger, but cast them out without delay like one would a demon from his body. If the feelings do not immediately subside, do not be like Amnon and seek council from an ungodly friend, but pray for God’s help to purge this impurity from our heart. Seek a brother or sister you trust to share this burden and strengthen you in prayer. Do not try to be strong, keep this matter concealed, and fend off Satan alone. My husband was formerly a social worker and once had a female client who made a pass at him. As a counselor, it was not out of the ordinary for clients to develop feelings of affection toward him, always to his indifference. But this particular case was different, and he felt uncomfortable in her presence. He sought a pastor for counsel, and the first thing the pastor told him to do was, “Go home and tell your wife.” So that evening, he confided in me, and we prayed together for God’s wisdom and guidance. Satan no longer had a heel to grab on, and for no explainable reason, the alluring woman never visited my husband again. Now what the devil wants a person to do in this situation is to keep the embarrassing matter a secret from his spouse so that the devil can grab him at an opportune time when he is isolated and spiritually weak. The Bible admonishes, “Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall” (1 Cor 10:12), and Mark Twain wrote, “There are several good protections against temptation, but the surest is cowardice.” In short, when it comes to temptation, we are to flee from it, not fight it. That is not to say that we should run away from anyone we meet who happens to be of the opposite sex, for they may very well be a chosen child of God for whom we were sent to lead to the path of salvation. It so happens that my husband came to the True Jesus Church because a sister casually invited him to a Bible study. WHAT ABOUT “MISSIONARY DATING”? Let us revisit the survey results. One has to wonder, how is it that the same people who believe it is not acceptable to marry someone outside of church feel that it may be acceptable to date one? Why would a Christian risk being romantically involved with a person that they know they cannot marry? The primary reason is that they have already become emotionally attracted to this person and are unwilling to turn back from following after him or her. It is always painful after opening up your heart, and that is why the wisest council offered is prevention—to repent immediately from a lustful thought and not let it get to the point where one has to choose between honoring God or this significant other. But if one must choose, then let us choose the One who gave His life for us and is worthy of our adoration. For your Maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is His name; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; He is called the God of the whole earth. (Isa 54:5) God is our first husband, and our faithfulness should be first and foremost towards Him. If we truly love our Lord and believe that He is worthy to be worshipped, then we will be faithful to Him, even if it means sacrificing some things that are important to us. However blissful, it is still only temporary. Even the best marriages on earth will one day dissolve, because God designed marriage to be a temporary relationship, as it is with all our relationships on earth. Whether it be with family or friends—they all end as soon as we die. The only everlasting relationship is our marriage with God and the fellowship we share with those joined in the kingdom of heaven. A second reason members date unbelievers may reside in the hope that the unbeliever will convert in the process. The optimistic point of view is that, sooner or later, their boyfriend or girlfriend will embrace God, become baptized, and then they could lawfully be married. We can probably point out a number of faithful brothers and sisters who happily came to the Lord after dating and marrying our church members, but it is absolutely critical in this matter that we separate and do not confuse God’s grace and mercy from His sovereign and explicit will, as expressed in His written word. A great biblical analogy is in the story of Jacob. Was it God’s will for Jacob to receive God’s blessings? Yes. Was it God’s will for Jacob to cheat, lie, and steal in order to receive it? Of course not. Like many of us, Jacob lacked patience. Yes, it is God’s will that all men come to believe and be saved, including the unbeliever you may be dating, but it is also positively against God’s will that we should enter into a sinful relationship in the name of accomplishing His will. How can we expect to shine as a light to this Gentile if we are an accomplice to their darkness? We often forget that God is God and has other means and methods to draw those He has chosen to Himself that would require no assistance on our part. So let us forget about converting someone through “missionary dating.” We are instructed, instead, to be wary and guarded when preaching to others, “but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh” (Jude 23). “But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified” (1 Cor 9:27). SEPARATING THE “IDEAL” FROM THE “FOR REAL” This may all sound very pithy and idealistic, but it is a frustrating exercise trying to reconcile the “ideal” from the “for real,” particularly when what we read in Scripture and hear from the pulpit is at odds with what is actually practiced and generally accepted at large. The reality is that we are all sinners, and as sinners, what we know and believe is often incongruent to how we actually behave. But unlike fallen man, we can trust that the Bible will never contradict itself. So as Paul wisely admonished young Timothy, Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you. (1 Tim 4:16) God is truth, and as true worshippers, we must worship Him in undiluted truth. Faith without truth is like salt that has lost its flavor. We must hold fast to the truth that we have received as if we were holding on for dear life, for if we let go of what is true, we no longer have a foundation on which our faith and church can stand. A final note on love—the highest kind of love is not the attraction felt between a man and a woman but the most selfless manifestation as described in 1 Corinthians chapter 13. We should thoughtfully consider the impact of our romantic interludes on the many other stakeholders besides us and the person we are in love with. Mixed marriages anger God, negatively impact the faith of our future children, and weaken the family and church. If we have always been faithful, let us continue to be faithful to the end. If we are at the onset of developing romantic feelings for a Gentile, let us repent and ask God to help us purge this sin from our heart. If we are currently involved in a relationship with an unbeliever, let us seek godly counsel."
1,13501,Should We Keep Christmas?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2009/th_uk_vyeung_christmas_6_13501.htm,"Should We Keep Christmas? Should We Keep Christmas? Vincent Yeung —Cambridge, UK CHRISTMAS IS A BIG DEAL Christmas is the biggest event on the UK calendar. Even in early December, the main themes in conversation are Christmas shopping, preparations for Christmas meals, and arrangements for family gatherings. Two weeks before the fateful day, Christmas decorations start to emerge in the office: bucket-loads of Christmas cards arrive through the mail or in the in-tray, and inexhaustible supplies of mince pies and chocolates accumulate in the tea room. Teams of carol singers, organized by charities and churches, ambush people for donations at train stations. Whether we like it or not, Christmas has arrived. For those who don’t celebrate Christmas, what can be done to ward off these intrusions? If someone were a Muslim, it is not unreasonable to say, “I am a Muslim, I don’t celebrate Christmas.” People could even claim, “I am an atheist,” or “I am a Jedi Knight, I don’t celebrate Christmas.” It is hard to say, “I am a Christian, but I do not celebrate Christmas.” As Christians, we actively engage and participate in and contribute to society. We spend most of our time with non–True Jesus Church friends, fellow students, clients, and colleagues (1 Cor 5:8-10). The dichotomy between what Jesus described as “out of the world” ( Jn 15:19) and yet “in the world” ( Jn 17:15) troubles many believers: How far do we integrate with society? Should we be involved in local customs and cultural activities? If we are involved, where should we draw a boundary that we would never cross? How should we respond to the disagreements among True Jesus Church members on this subject? These issues must be resolved as well for Christmas. A Mixed Bag of Pagan and Religious Traditions 1 Christmas as we know it is an amalgamation of practices, customs, and stories that have been memorized and passed down for generations. The diversity of these traditions lack coherence and connections with Christian belief, to say nothing of the practices originating from pagan roots. A typical Christmas-observing family might have a Christmas tree in the living room. The youngsters in the family take part in re-creating the Nativity at school. Family and friends exchange gifts that parents and children attribute to a character called Santa Claus. Some people trace the origin of the Christmas tree to before the Christian era; trees and boughs were used in ancient cultures for ceremonial purposes. The ancient Egyptians, in celebrating the winter solstice (the shortest day of the year), brought green date palms into their homes as a symbol of life triumphing over death. When the Romans observed the feast of Saturn, part of the ceremony was the raising of an evergreen bough. The early Scandinavians were said to have paid homage to evergreen trees. Mistletoe has a special place in British Christmas celebrations. A branch of mistletoe is hung up in the house and, according to the custom of Christmas cheer, any two people who meet under it are obliged to kiss. This tradition has roots in the belief that mistletoe could grant fertility. Today, schools and churches arrange visits to nursing homes where they sing familiar Christmas songs. Many families enjoy Christmas traditions that focus on community events, such as attending a Christmas parade. Religious Christmas celebrations marking the birth of Jesus usually center on Christmas Eve. Roman Catholic churches celebrate the first Christmas mass at midnight, and Protestant churches hold Christmas candlelight service late on Christmas Eve. Tradition Without Faith Despite the religious background of Christmas, the holiday has become nearly devoid of religious content in the UK. To the majority, Christmas has become watered down to a godless excess of presents, food, and partying. Even atheists enjoy the music of the season, delight in receiving special gifts from family and friends, and wish everyone a “Merry Christmas.” The question is, Is there a problem with taking part in a celebration that is devoid of religious content? We can hardly be rebuked for remembering, respecting, and taking part in Remembrance Day.* Many True Jesus Church members consider everything that is associated with Christmas as taboo. If we follow such reasoning, we should not engage in any aspect of Christmas: no Christmas lunch at the canteen, no receiving Christmas cards, no attending Christmas functions. Undoubtedly, such a “scorched earth” policy would insulate members from all harm. However, blind adherence devoid of true knowledge and understanding is no better than superstition and ultimately cannot stand the test of time. Only when we are able to rationalize and internalize our belief through the word of God and the Holy Spirit can we stand firm and act responsibly and sensibly. OBSERVING GOD’S COMMANDS The Bible unequivocally and unreservedly reminds us to adhere to the commandments of the Lord. The chosen people must not follow the ways of the other nations in worshipping their gods. As an illustration of this principle, the Lord did not allow pillars and images near His altar (Deut 16:20, 21). We cannot supplant God with other gods, nor are we allowed to set up a way of worship in addition to what He has commanded us (Deut 12:2-4). Worshipping idols and burning their children (Deut 12:31) were religious acts in which the users believed that they could evoke a response from their gods. The 450 prophets of Baal cried loudly and cut themselves (1 Kgs 18:28), but there was no effect. Even though the false prophets truly believed in what they were doing, their gods did not grant their request. Although Satan may use such opportunities to carry out his work, false beliefs do not bring any benefit and have no effect. The Lord commanded His chosen people not to cut themselves nor make any baldness between the eyes for the dead (Deut 14:1). As God’s children, we shall not do to the Lord as the other nations have done to their gods. Moses told the Israelites, “You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way; for every abomination to the LORD which He hates they have done to their gods; for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods. Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.” (Deut 12:31, 32) The prohibition can be examined on three levels. False Beliefs Any system, belief, or practice that establishes its own righteousness in place of God’s righteousness is false and not acceptable to God. Any system of belief that operates in parallel with or supplements the traditional doctrines and common faith should be abandoned (Col 2:16-23). Neither Christmas nor the observance of the birth of Jesus has biblical justification. If we believe that attending Christmas service or celebrating Christmas is a must, then it is a false belief. We should not take part in such activities because our faith will be compromised. The lack of clarity in our faith and lack of trust in the Lord often lead to the adulteration of our belief and practices. This could be as subtle as carrying a lucky charm that gives us peace of mind. It could be in the form of active participation in religious rites and acts (Gal 4:9-10; Col 2:16-23) or active avoidance of certain food (Rom 14:2). If anyone doubts his own belief, it is not of faith, and that is sin (Rom 14:23). Similarly, believing that eating mince pies or hanging mistletoe in our homes brings luck is in opposition to the Bible’s teachings. Such beliefs are false and can bring no benefit, only harm. Symbolism Symbolism, whether religious or secular, plays a significant part in our lives. Prestigious brands are symbols of wealth, status, and exclusivity. Wearing a poppy or a wrist band of a certain color signifies solidarity and support to a common cause or value. Symbolism also plays a very important part in the Bible. Circumcision is a token of the covenant between God and Abraham (Gen 17:11); the rainbow is a token of the covenant between God and the earth (Gen 9:12, 13). Binding the word of God on their hand, between the eyes, writing it on the post of a house and at the gate signify an absolute adherence to God’s word (Deut 6:8, 9). Symbols by themselves bring no value if the holders do not actualize such values in their life; rather, it inculcates a sense of false security. The Pharisees made their phylacteries broad and enlarged the borders of their garments (Mt 23:5) as a symbol of their piety; this brought them no praise from Jesus because they were more interested in man’s praise than in putting the commands of God into practice. Joel reminded the people to tear their hearts and not their robes (Joel 2:13). We must be sensitive to what we wear, carry, and do. Putting a Christmas tree in the living room may symbolize that we are sharing the values of the holiday, which may mean drinking excessively, attending wild parties, going to festive family and social gatherings, or celebrating Jesus’ birth. As a True Jesus Church member, we need to ask, “Do I share these values?” and “Why am I involved in things that I do not agree with or subscribe to?” If we do not share these values, what is the point in celebrating Christmas? Physical and Spiritual Harm For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s. (1 Cor 6:20) God has chosen us out of the world, and the world hates us (Jn 15:19), yet Jesus did not pray to take us out of the world (Jn 17:15). It is human nature to want to be liked by people around us: our family, friends, and colleagues. But our “otherness” as the children of God sets us apart from the world and is the reason why the world hates us (Jn 15:19). The more we assimilate ourselves with this world, the more we are liked by it. We must be aware of the spiritual harm and danger we expose ourselves and our brethren to by participating in Christmas activities. The act of exchanging Christmas gifts or installing a Christmas tree in our living room is not a sin. However, it is part of the process of assimilation that we are subconsciously subscribing to. God warned His people vociferously over the ages not to follow the practices of the nations (Deut 8:19). The pattern of sound words has once and for all been entrusted to the saints and passed from one generation to the other (Jude 3; 2 Tim 1:13, 2:2). We cannot ignore or change God’s words. Satan is used to changing God’s commandments subtly and successfully causing people to sin (Gen 3:4; Jude 4). We must be alert to avoid giving ground to the devil by understanding that apostasy is a process—like Lot gradually moving his tents towards Sodom (Gen 13:12), we slowly drift away from the truth while picking up the traditions and practices of the world. ENGAGE POSITIVELY IN THE WORLD In Deuteronomy 22:9-11, the Lord warns us not to mix different types of seeds, animals, and fabrics. Why would the Lord worry about these material things? Is He not referring to something more profound? Jesus has set a good example for us to follow—He was in the world yet did not belong to this world. He was accused of wining and dining, indicating that He engaged occasionally in worldly activities, such as attending a wedding feast. Yet at other times, He led an ascetic life, fasting and praying. He was sensitive to the physical and emotional needs of others and did not mind breaking the rules (human traditions) and raising a few eyebrows. Such pragmatism is what we should emulate. We do not actively embrace Christmas traditions by sending out Christmas cards, by putting up a Christmas tree or decorations in our lounge, or by organizing Christmas parties at work or university; neither should we shrink from an engagement during the Christmas period. If we are participating in Christmas-time activities, such as attending a Christmas meal or allowing young children to be part of their school Christmas program, we need to ask these questions: Does the activity have any religious meaning both to us and to those who invite us to take part? If the answer is no, then it is no different from any other secular event. Then we should ask, Are we exposing ourselves to any physical or spiritual harm? Are we sending the wrong signal to those who are weak or confused in their faith? If so, it is better not to take part in such activities. With the correct mindset, it is not a sin to participate passively in certain Christmas-time events, knowing that it is not true. For example, it is not a sin to receive a Christmas card as long as we know that it is just a gesture of goodwill from a fellow member of society. Nevertheless, we do not want to be perceived to hold false values. So, if a friend invites us to a get-together during Christmas, we need not be afraid to accept. But we must remember that we should put on the image of Jesus wherever we go. 1. http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=1284&display_order=5&mini_id=1290 *Remembrance Day is an annual holiday observed in the UK on the second Sunday in November in memory of those who have died in war."
1,13502,What Do We Hallow?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2009/th_us_bjyuan_halloween_6_13502.htm,"What Do We Hallow? What Do We Hallow? Rebecca Yuan—Canoga Park, California, USA My first memory of Halloween was as a six-year-old in Texas. I remember my parents dimming the lights and telling us to be quiet so the trick-or-treaters would believe that nobody was home. That experience became a model for years to come. Like many other True Jesus Church members, my parents believed that Halloween was associated with evil spirits and should be avoided. However, in recent times, there seems to be a shift in some of our church members’ perception of Halloween. We view it as a part of American culture, a harmless community or social event. Our children dress up for school Halloween parades, our youth attend costume parties, and our adults go to work in character. To be a good neighbor (or to appease pranksters), we greet and provide candy for trick-or-treaters. Sometimes, we even let our kids go trick-or-treating with other church kids. Is the traditional church stance on Halloween antiquated, just as our former ban on permed hair or the strict division of male-female seating in church? If yes, then why are so many other Christians opposed to Halloween participation? Are we being overly conservative when avoiding a festivity that promotes community spirit, creativity, and good, clean, fun? What exactly are we hallowing or celebrating when we participate in Halloween? ORIGINS OF HALLOWEEN Although Halloween is a largely commercial holiday, it still contains many influences from its pagan past. As we examine the history of Halloween, we can see the spiritual significances that exist behind its modern-day rituals. Samhain, the Festival of the Dead The roots of Halloween can be traced back to an ancient Celtic festival called “Samhain” (meaning “Summer’s end,” pronounced “sow-en”). 1 The festival took place on October 31 and marked the beginning of the dark season, which was associated with death and the waning of the sun. The ancient Britons believed that on this day the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred. The dead could return to visit their family and friends, and the living could be tricked into passing into the other side. 2 Therefore, people did what they could to protect themselves. Celtic priests called “Druids” built sacred bonfires for people to burn animal, crop, and even human sacrifices to appease Muck Olla, the sun god, and Samhain, the god of death. 1 During the ritual, people wore costumes made of animal heads and skins, danced, sang, and jumped over fires to scare away evil spirits. At home, food was left outside to appease roaming spirits, and turnips were carved into lanterns with faces to ward off evil ones. 2 If someone had to leave home after dark, they would wear a guise for protection. 3 For some, it was an opportunity to play pranks on each other since abnormalities could be attributed to the spirits. For others, it was a good opportunity to have one’s fortune told because the presence of supernatural beings made it easier to predict the future. 3 When the Romans conquered Celtic territory in AD 434, Samhain became intertwined with the Roman festival of “Feralia.” This was a day in late October in which the dead were remembered. The day following Feralia honored Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and gardens. The symbol for Pomona was the apple, which explains the custom of “bobbing” for apples. 3 Hallowmas Christendom “inherited Hallowe’en from Pagan times” when Ireland was converted to Christianity in the 5 th century. 4 In AD 835, Pope Gregory IV tried to replace Samhain with a church-sanctioned holiday by declaring November 1 as All Saints’ Day to honor saints and martyrs. 3 By AD 900, the church realized that All Saints’ had not supplanted pre-Christian customs, so it established All Souls’ Day on November 2 to recognize all faithful souls that had died during the previous year. 5 The celebrations were reminiscent of Samhain, with bonfires, parades, and people dressing up in costumes. To discourage people from leaving food out for the spirits, the church encouraged the practice of giving “soul-cakes.” Poor families would beg for food, and families would give them pastries called “soul-cakes” in exchange for prayer for the family’s dead relatives. Together, All Saints’ Eve, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day collectively became “Hallowmas.” 3 Americanization of Halloween Large populations of Irish immigrants fleeing the Potato Famine of 1846 brought their Halloween traditions to America. On October 31, the new immigrants would dress up, play pranks, beg for money door-to-door, and tell fortunes with apples and nuts (symbols of Pomona and Samhain). 4 They also carved lanterns out of pumpkins, a New World vegetable that was bigger and easier to work with than turnips. Unfortunately, the pranks turned into real destruction of homes and businesses by the 1920’s. 6 This prompted communities to seek more benign alternatives for the night. “Good” children were encouraged to dress up and receive treats from shops and homes that they visited. The phrase “Trick or treat!” was coined as a greeting, and an American version of Halloween came about. By the 1930’s, October 31 was referred to as “beggar’s night” and celebrated nation-wide. 6 Halloween in America was sanctioned as a neighborhood-oriented children’s holiday until the 1970’s, when adult activities became popular once more. 8 Retail chains and amusement parks joined in and pushed the commercial importance of the “scary” holiday. Today, Halloween is one of the highest grossing commercial holidays, involving young and old alike. 7 Meanwhile, there has been some spiritual revival of Halloween in America. In places such as Salem, Massachusetts, modern-day witches gather in the month of October in anticipation of the annual Feast of Samhain on Halloween Eve. 9 The festival is a revival of the ancient Celtic festival, complete with Samhain fire, witchcraft, chanting, and the honoring of Roman and Canaanite goddesses. 9 Modern-day Satanists also view October 31 as their “highest of holy days.” 10 HALLOWING WHAT? Researching and learning about the history of Halloween left me in shock. I was disturbed by the dark, spiritual roots of Halloween. I also recognized the similarities between Halloween and the pagan Chinese Ghost Month. The Chinese Ghost Month is a period of time during the seventh month of the lunar calendar in which the gates of hell are believed to be opened. Therefore, people parade the streets in frightening costumes of ghosts and gods, burn incense and paper money, and offer food to wandering ghosts (especially those who died unnaturally and cannot rest). These idol-worshipping festivities are incontestably unbiblical. However, the same elements are packaged as something fun and child-oriented in the Western world and accepted by some church members. This causes me to think: If to “hallow” is to “make holy,” what exactly are we hallowing when we celebrate Halloween? Community spirit? Friendship? Conformity? Indulgence? Gluttony? ...God? Are we sending out a message to our children that we truly believe the first part of the Lord’s prayer ? “Our Father in heaven , Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.” (Mt 6:9, 10) BIBLICAL GUIDELINES ON HALLOWEEN After emailing my preliminary research to friends and church students before last Halloween, I received mixed reactions. Some parents decided to pull their young children out of Halloween festivities. Others were still not convinced of the dangers of Halloween. After all, commercialism seems to have overtaken the spiritual significance of the holiday, and the Bible does not specifically refute Halloween. Yet, the book of life provides wonderful guidance on matters pertaining to our daily living. Here are some biblical principles that may help us decide about Halloween: Glorify God and Edify Our Brothers We often hear, “Everything is permissible”—but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible”—but not everything is constructive. Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. (1 Cor 10:23, 24, NIV) Before we participate in Halloween, let us consider the effect of our actions. Will our actions glorify God before unbelievers? Will it edify our fellow brethren? Jesus tells us that we need to glorify God as the salt and light of the earth. As salt, we need to have the distinct flavor of God so we may season and better the lives of others. If we lose our Christian qualities, we become “good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men” (Mt 5:13). Jesus also says to us, “You are the light of the world …[ l]et your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.” (Mt 5:14, 16) Yes, we may show community spirit and befriend others by joining local Halloween activities, but do our actions reveal the glory of God? When we hand out sweets to trick-or-treaters, do we guide others to the peace and joy of Christ? Or does it cause the flavor of our faith to appear bland and indistinctive from those of the world? Let us remember that we are ambassadors of Christ (2 Cor 5:20), representing an unseen God to the people in this world who need God’s salvation. As “a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people,” our job is to “proclaim the praises of Him who called [us] out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Pet 2:9) and lead others to eternal life. We also need to make sure that our actions are edifying to others. Even though our own participation in Halloween may not affect our faith, we may signal to a new or young believer that it is harmless to participate in other activities that are unedifying or even dangerous. For example, although we may know to avoid tarot card reading at a Halloween event, a new believer who doesn’t fully understand God’s abomination of divination may be led to believe it is benign. When our children receive permission from us to dress up as their favorite fantasy character, they may not be able to distinguish fictional witchcraft from real occult practices. Whatever we do, the exercise of our freedom should not become a stumbling block to the weak (1 Cor 8:19). Scripture encourages us, “[W]hether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.” (1 Cor 10:31-33, NIV) Avoid What Is Detestable in God’s Sight Before the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, God told them, “When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. You must be blameless before the LORD your God.” (Deut 18:9-13) Although most participants in Halloween no longer practice human or animal sacrifice, the themes of divination, witchcraft, and consultation of the dead have been, and still are, staple elements of the holiday. Divination in the form of fortune-telling is viewed as popular and harmless. Witches and their black cats are ubiquitously honored on Halloween decorations. The return of the dead is portrayed through characters such as zombies, vampires, mummies, ghosts, and goblins. To not inadvertently promote or involve ourselves in witchcraft, divination, or the returning dead, we must be even more careful to separate ourselves from things that are detestable to our Lord Jesus during Halloween. As Peter reminds us, [B]ut as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy .” (1 Pet 1:15, 16) Be Aware that We Are Fighting a Spiritual Battle Lastly, we need to be aware that we are constantly fighting a spiritual battle. Ephesians 6:12 tells us, For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, our physical acts often have spiritual consequences. For example, when we participate in sacraments such as baptism, footwashing, and Holy Communion, we are united and take part in Christ (Rom 6:5; Jn 13:8; 1 Cor 10:16); when we eat food sacrificed to idols, we become affiliated with demons (1 Cor 10:19, 20); when we commit sexual immorality, we sin against the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:18, 19). The danger in participating in Halloween activities is that we may give Satan a foothold by unwittingly doing something with spiritual meaning. As a holiday that emphasizes material gratification and abnormalities, Halloween may also be used by Satan to tempt us to sin. The devil “walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Pet 5:6). He tempts us with the same things he tempted our Lord Jesus with—“the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life” (1 Jn 2:16). For children, these temptations may be manifested in massive amounts of candy and the ownership of a cool costume. For youths and adults, they may take form as sensual indulgence (drunkenness and dancing) and visual stimulation (provocative costumes), or the satisfaction of social acceptance. For us to live a spiritually victorious life, we must flee from these temptations. We must not have “even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people” (Eph 5:3, NIV). Instead, we need to fill our mind with the following: [W]hatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy. (Phil 4:8) This means that sometimes we have to sacrifice a sense of belonging and feel like “aliens and strangers in the world” (1 Pet 2:11, NIV). However, if we are able to truly live for Christ, our reward will be worth it. As Hebrews 10:36 tells us, “[Y]ou have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise. ” CONCLUSION Whether or not to participate in Halloween is often a difficult decision. On the one hand, we do not want to feel excluded from society or have our children harbor resentment toward our beliefs. We also feel that it is a secular holiday that does not harm our faith. On the other hand, we don’t want to disobey our Lord Jesus, intentionally or not. Hopefully, by learning more about the background of Halloween, we can make a better-informed decision regarding the holiday. If we still have a hard time deciding about our family’s Halloween participation, let us ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and discernment. As the Psalmist prayed: “Teach me, O LORD, to follow your decrees; then I will keep them to the end. Give me understanding and I will keep your law And obey it with all my heart. Direct me in the path of your commands, For there I find delight.” (Ps 119:33-35) 1. Russo, Steve, Halloween , Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, Oregon, 1998, p. 18 2.

And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho , that he lifted his eyes and looked . . . (Josh 5:13a) What was Joshua doing, looking at Jericho ? What was going through his mind? He knew God had a mission for him. Here we are. This is the enemy we’re to destroy. It starts here. Jericho is like our sinful nature. It’s evil, it’s strong, and it must be destroyed. How do we view our Jerichos ? Do we survey them from a distance, pondering over how to conquer them? Or are we caught up in the joys of Jericho , living according to the flesh, stimulating our emotions with movies and music, buying satisfaction from materialism, and laughing off gossip and profanity? There’s no sense of mission in that kind of lifestyle. There’s no urgency to conquer. That’s not surveying Jericho —that’s living in it. As Christians, we’ve left Egypt . We’ve been justified by faith and baptized—Christ’s blood has removed the reproach of our sins. We’re enjoying God’s blessings spiritually and physically. Maybe we’re thinking that’s it—“I’m saved!” But, crossing the Jordan isn’t the end; it is the beginning. Perhaps in our hearts there still lies a vast land infested with firmly-planted sinful desires that have yet to be uprooted. Do we feel a sense of mission and urgency like Joshua felt, to face the daunting and arduous battles ahead? Did we cross over the river Jordan armed and prepared for war (Josh 4:12, 13)? And behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand . . . He said, “No, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshipped . . . Then the Commander of the LORD’s army said to Joshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so. (Josh 5:13b-15) Joshua encountered God personally. He was able to stand on holy ground. What is our mindset? Are we standing afar outside of Jericho looking upon it with purpose, or are we standing in it, enjoying its illusion of fortitude and pleasure? Where we stand determines whether or not we encounter God. It determines whether we are on His side. It determines whether our feet are on holy ground. Where do we stand? Question for Reflection: Do you feel a sense of mission and urgency to face the daunting and arduous battles ahead?"

1,20695,Baptism for Salvation—Act of Faith or of Works?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2011/ds_baptismfaithwork_6_20695.htm,"Baptism for Salvation—Act of Faith or of Works? Baptism for Salvation—Act of Faith or of Works? Based on “The Doctrine of Baptism ” , published by True Jesus Church Department of Literary Ministry To baptize disciples of all nations is a direct command of our risen Lord Jesus (Mt 28:18–20). In addition, to be baptized is a calling of our Lord to all who believe in Him and the gospel that offers the promise of salvation (Mk 16:15–16). Wherever the gospel of Jesus Christ is preached, His baptism must follow. Whoever calls on the name of the Lord Jesus must be baptized. Baptism is so integral to the proclamation of God’s kingdom and faith in Christ that it is inseparable from conversion. Yet there are many who deny the necessity of baptism or its saving effect. One chief objection to the belief in the necessity of baptism for salvation is that baptism is of works, and as such cannot be a condition for salvation. It is argued that assigning any saving effect to a rite such as baptism discredits and nullifies the finished work of Christ on the cross. If this understanding of baptism stands, then teaching salvation through baptism would be dangerously close to requiring circumcision for salvation, a position the apostle Paul vehemently rejects. In fact, Paul was one of the most prominent defenders of salvation apart from works. He goes as far as declaring that any attempt to be justified by works is a total denial of God’s grace, “And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.” (Gal 5:3, 4) In view of the fundamental doctrine of salvation by grace through faith, how are we to understand baptism? Baptism is God in action Those who deny the saving effects of baptism tend to speak of baptism primarily as something that man does. This, however, is not the perspective of the Scriptures. The passages that record New Testament baptism hardly mention the baptist (examples: Acts 2:3–41; 8:4–17; 8:26–40; 9:17–19; 16:13–15; 16:29–34; 19:1–7). Similarly, the act of being baptized on the part of the believer is never viewed as being responsible for the spiritual benefits that result in baptism. In baptism it is God who acts. The human actions are only a humble reception of the divine act. It is God who washes away our sins with the blood of Christ (Hebr 10:19–22; 9:14), buries us together with Christ into His death, raises us with Christ (Col 2:12; Rom 6:1–11), and brings us into the body of Christ (1 Cor 12:12–13). While willing participation on behalf of the believer is necessary, it does not warrant any merit except for the fact that it is an act of obedience. The Scriptures never consider this act of obedience as the foundation of the saving effects in baptism, but always attribute them to the grace of God in Christ Jesus (Tit 3:4–7; Eph 2:4–9). Baptism is God’s grace To examine whether baptism is of works, we need to first consider the meaning of the term “works.” By “works of the law” the Scriptures are speaking of attempting to achieve righteousness by observing and meeting the requirements of the law. The nature of this means to justification is that it seeks to earn righteousness before God rather than to receive it freely. Herein lies the distinction between justification by works and justification by faith: the former claims man’s merit, but the latter does not; the former denies the works of Christ, but the latter rests upon them. Thus, it would be wrong to view any and all forms of actions as “works of the law.” To believe is an action, just as repentance and confessing the name of Christ are actions. But such actions are actions that respond to and receive the grace of God. They do not constitute attempts to be justified by works. Baptism is an integral part of salvation by grace through faith Nowhere in the Scriptures can we find any reference to baptism being associated with the works of the law. On the contrary, the Scriptures present baptism in the context of grace and faith. Take the baptism passage in Colossians for example: In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses. (Col 2:11–13) Even though baptism is at the heart of this passage, we see no indication whatsoever that baptism is of the works of the law. In fact, it is an instrument of God’s grace. It is Christ who circumcises us, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh. It is He who makes us alive together with Him. It is He who forgives all our trespasses. All of these works done by the hand of Christ take effect in us in baptism. This passage further teaches us that our resurrection with Christ in baptism is through faith in the working of God. Faith in God’s grace underlies the spiritual effect of baptism. Baptism is of faith, not of works. This is further re-emphasized in Ephesians 2:1–13, a key passage on God’s saving grace: But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. (Eph 2:4–9) Both the passage in Colossians and in Ephesians talks about our former death in sin and state of uncircumcision. Both speak of being made alive and raised up together with Christ. Both attribute the spiritual transformations to the work of God. While Ephesians 2:1–13 stresses that we have been saved by grace through faith, the parallel passage in Colossians highlights baptism as the occasion for God’s saving work. There is perfect harmony between these passages, and one supplements the other. Baptism is in no way opposed to salvation by grace through faith, but is actually an integral part of it. We’ve established that baptism is an action that responds to God’s grace, and that it is God who works in baptism. Through baptism the blood of Christ washes away the sins of the believer (Acts 2:38; 22:16), the body of sin is put off (Rom 6:1–7; Col 2:11–12) and salvation is given (Mk 16:16; Tit 3:5; 1 Pet 3:21). In other words, as sinners, our conscience is defiled (Heb 9:9; 10:2 ,22 ; cf. Tit 1:15). However, when our hearts are “sprinkled from an evil conscience”, we are able to draw near to God (Heb 10:22) and respond to God with a good conscience. This is exactly what God does through baptism: He purifies our conscience with the blood of Christ, so that we can have boldness in the day of judgment . It is in this sense that baptism saves us. It is for this reason that we need to be baptized to receive salvation."

1,23052,Whom Do I Serve?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2012/mi_au_achu_whomserve_web_23052.htm,"Whom Do I Serve? Whom Do I Serve? AC Whom do I serve? The answer to this question is straightforward to us Christians: we serve the living and true God, the Creator, the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, apart from serving God, many of us serve another master, whether it is mammon (Mt 6:23; Lk 15:13) or our own belly (Rom 16:17–18; Jude 12–13)—our various lusts and pleasures (Tit 3:3). For this reason, the question “Whom do I serve?”, gives room for self-reflection, and reminds us that we belong to God alone (Act 27:23), and should serve the Lord with all our heart, through our worship and participation in His business. Once we have ensured that we worship and serve God only, what are the attitudes that we should have in our worship and service to Him? The Bible uses different human relationships to describe the relationship we have with God and our attitude towards Him. Let us narrow our scope and look at three of them. He is our Master, We are the bondservants Previously we were slaves of sin, uncleanness and lawlessness. Yet, through baptism, we have become slaves of righteousness (Rom 6:22). Since Jesus has purchased us with His own blood (Act 20:28), we belong to Him—He is our Master and we are His servants. The apostles had this kind of understanding when they introduced themselves at the beginning of their epistles as bondservants of Jesus Christ (Rom 1:1; Jas 1:1; 2 Pet 1:1; Jude 1). In fact, the Lord often used parables that describe the relationship between master and servant to illustrate His expectations towards His followers. So, what is the attitude expected from a bondservant in his service to the master? “Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ” (Eph 6:5). Obedience to the master is the fundamental quality expected from a bondservant or slave. Obedience is also expected from children to their parents (Eph 6:1) and wives to their husbands (Eph 5:22). Yet the unique characteristic of the obedience shown in a master-slave relationship is “fear and trembling” . A slave who has recognized his unworthiness and lowliness will always respect his master, and rightly so! The better we understand the majesty of our holy, glorious and almighty God (Isa 6:1–5), the more we will respect Him with fear and trembling. We should have a God-fearing heart when we come before God. This is the right footing in starting our relationship with Him. It also forms the basis for a growing relationship. Many Christians today emphasize on an equal love relationship with God. The danger of which is, without godly fear, one would easily end up being disobedient. This usually begins with complaining about God’s ways of doing things and eventually rejecting God’s authority. Moreover, godly fear will enable us to be submissive until the end, even if we face situations beyond our understanding that may create doubts in us. The willingness of Jesus to submit to the will of the Father best illustrates the importance of godly fear. The author of Hebrews quoted that it is this godly fear which enabled Jesus’ prayer to be heard (Heb 5:7). Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure. (Phil 2:12–13) “Fear and trembling” is the attitude we should maintain in our journey of faith, for it rectifies our hearts and gives us no room for pride or arrogance, knowing that it is God who is working in us. He is our Father, We are His firstborn God created man in His own image and Adam had the status of God’s child. Although Adam later fell short of the glory of God, our sonship is restored today through the Lord’s salvation grace. In the eyes of God, we are precious and beloved as a firstborn in a family (Heb 12:23), and as such we have the promise of a heavenly inheritance. With privilege come responsibilities, in that we, as firstborn sons, must be about our Father’s business (Lk 2:49). Contrary to what is being practiced in many modern-day families, where parents serve their children even when they are able to take care of themselves, God expects us to serve Him. For this reason, He told Pharaoh, “So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me” (Ex 4:22–23). As we serve our heavenly Father, what should be our attitude? “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. ‘ Honor your father and your mother,’ which is the first commandment with promise” (Eph 6:1–2). Again the Bible mentions obedience. However, in a father-son relationship, honor or respect is introduced and emphasized. For this reason, we should consider whether we are bringing honor or disrepute to the holy name of our heavenly Father as we serve Him. The other equally important concern is whether we are bringing honor to Him or to ourselves. The importance of both aspects is best illustrated in the Lord’s Prayer. Jesus taught us to begin with “Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name” and to end it with “For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (Mt 6:9–13). He is our Husband, to whom we have been betrothed No other human relationship is more intimate than that between a husband and a wife. Paul used this to describe the mystery concerning Christ and the church. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. (Eph 5:31–32) Husband and wife can never be separated because they have become one. Likewise Christ and the church are one and thus inseparable. The love of Christ is the foundation of this oneness. What hinders this perfect unification is our lack of unreserved love towards Him. “I drew them with gentle cords, with bands of love, and I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck. I stooped and fed them” (Hos 11:4). “Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases”(Song 2:7b). Does He still need to ask us, “Do you love me?” (Jn 21:15–17), before we respond to His unreserved love for us? “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength” (Deut 6:4). “For love is as strong as death” (Song 8:6). In our service to God, we should not only focus on the outward act of obedience, for such actions can come from someone with a heart of reluctance and a mouth of murmurings. Instead, we should say, “I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me” (Song 7:10). How beautiful and different will our service be, if it is motivated by true love for God! Whom do I serve? Do it to the least among you When we say we serve God, it does not mean that He needs anything from us, for He is our Creator and provider (Acts 17:24–25). So even before we think about what we can do to serve Him, we should firstly glorify and thank Him through our daily lives and worship. So what can we do to serve God although He does not need anything from us? Based on the principle “if we did it to one of the least of these, we did it to our Lord” (Mt 25:40), we serve God by serving our brethren. By the will of God, David served his own generation (Acts 13:36). Similarly, the will of God is for us to serve one another through love (Gal 5:13). “As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace” (1 Pet 4:10). Maintaining a life-long service In our life of service, we will inevitably face setbacks that will discourage us even to the point of giving up, for serving our brethren means that we are serving imperfect men. In addition, we are imperfect as well. Although Moses was indeed a faithful servant (Heb 3:5) in God’s entire household, he could not bear it when the meat-craving people wept and complained to him (Num 11:1–15). Subsequently, Moses turned to the Lord who chose seventy men to help him manage the people, opening a way so he could continue serving. While we humbly serve the Lord, we must also be prepared to face trials and sufferings. In fact, Paul told the saints in Philippi that it is a grace and special privilege, not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for His sake (Phil 1:29–30). Paul’s secret to maintaining his life-long, diligent and fervent service to the Lord can be summed up in the following actions: “rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer” (Rom 12:11–12). Therefore, following Paul’s footsteps, let us always remember that we can take joy in serving our Lord. We can find joy in serving God together with our fellow brethren and have the confidence that He will accomplish His own good work. When putting this into practice, it means that we remain focused on our ultimate heavenly objective, and always remember that our Master and our prize await us above (cf. Phil 1:3–5; 3:1,3; 1:6; 1:18,16; 3:20–21; 3:12–14). Finally, when we should require it, indeed, the joy of the Lord is our strength (Neh 8:10)! May we all imitate the many servants of the living God, to serve God continually, day and night, for God who sits on the throne is dwelling among us (Rev 7:5)!"
1,25014,What Can I Do?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2012/yc_sg_echsieh_whatcan_7_25014.htm,"What Can I Do? What Can I Do? En Chia Hsieh—Singapore There is a children’s hymn, entitled “We All Can Do Something for Jesus”. The hymn reminds us that everyone can serve the Lord, even if it is just through a word of kindness, a simple hymn or a cup of cold water. WHY SERVE FROM YOUNG? In addition, the hymn tells us that serving the Lord requires training, which needs to start early. From Israel’s history, we can see that the earlier the next generation was trained, the better their quality as servants. Serving the Lord is to bear the yoke for Him. Although we may not be able to bear a heavy yoke at a young age, we must be willing to be as a soft lump of clay, ready to be molded by the potter. Every wise farmer knows that an ox needs to bear the yoke from young, while he is still flexible and able to learn. In this way, he will work hard, learn to bear hardship, and will eventually be of optimal help to the farmer. On the contrary, an old ox is stubborn in his ways and difficult to teach, less efficient, and may even end up as a burden to the farmer. When a farmer trains a young ox, he usually puts him together with an experienced ox, so that the younger may observe and learn from the older one. Under the influence of the older ox, the young animal will gradually learn the skill to serve and develop a spirit of longsuffering. The same pattern is evident throughout the Bible: When Moses talked to God in the tent of meeting, Joshua would be there, listening too. Elisha served Elijah before he was handed the baton. Paul chose Timothy at Lystra to accompany him on his missionary journey. Observing and learning from others will help us realize our strengths. For this reason, we should take up the opportunity to accompany experienced workers and participate in various church works, learning on the job. HOW CAN WE GET INVOLVED? Today, holy work is much more diversified compared to the time of the early church. The purpose, however, is the same: to cater for the believers’ needs and to create a better worship environment. Today, we can serve God in many different areas of church work. The following are starting points, from which we can delve into further fields of service. 1. Evangelism: Youths are one of the groups most receptive to the gospel. So, as youths we are the most suitable candidates to preach to our peers. Youths are also often perceived as the engine of the church. If we do not have the enthusiasm to preach, who else can the church count on for such zeal? We may feel that we lack the ability to evangelize, but we can all share personal testimonies, how our families came to believe and our experiences of the Holy Spirit. Even merely inviting our friends to “come and see” can lead people to the Lord. Most importantly, through our actions, we can touch those around us who are yet to believe. 2. Bible studies and sharing: Moreover the church often lacks members who are willing and able to care for truth-seekers and to lead truth-seeker Bible study classes. Only those who truly love the word of God and have the heart to “rightly divide the word of truth” (2 Tim 15) are competent enough to take on this task. Willing youths can shadow their elders who are experienced in this field to answer queries and expound the truth regarding Christianity, as well as the True Jesus Church articles of faith. 3. Work in pioneering areas: Today there are many pioneering areas that require pastoral care. Those who work in this field need to contact members, sermonize, lead Bible studies, and visit local members and truth seekers, including those in developing countries. Visiting such places can broaden our horizons and help us develop a better understanding of service to God. Quite often, members who visit brethren in less-developed countries will gain a wider perspective and realize how insignificant their own problems are in comparison. Moreover, while these brethrens’ lives are not materially abundant, they may be more joyful. 4. Care for the elderly: Due to the aging of society, there are more and more elderly members in church who need our care and concern. As physically able youths, we should extend a helping hand to those who use walking sticks or are bound by wheelchairs, and talk to them during free time on the Sabbath day. When the church arranges visits to the homes of those with long-term illnesses, the presence of youths can add vitality and joy. At the same time, youths can learn from the wisdom and experience of the elderly. WHOM DO WE SERVE? Youths must also understand whom we serve, so as not to strive to please men more than God. We do not serve to receive men’s praise. King Saul was more concerned about the voice of the Israelites than about God’s voice; he was more afraid to lose the support of the people than the abidance of God. Thus, Saul went beyond his authority to offer sacrifices, losing the abidance of God and, eventually, the heart of his people. We must therefore examine our attitudes: are we afraid to hinder the divine work or are we afraid to lose face? In other words, is our service to God motivated by the desire to glorify God or ourselves? The skills for serving God can be cultivated—we need not worry. More importantly, we must adopt the correct mindset as we serve the Lord. Service that pleases God is not to do what others do or are pleased with, but to understand the needs of the church and to do our best without shrinking back when others criticize us. “I’M NOT GOOD ENOUGH” Sometimes we may feel we are not qualified to serve God because we think that we are not charismatic, eloquent or educated. Yet we need to remember that God looks at our hearts, not our abilities. Mary of Bethany might not have been able to do what the disciples did, but she gave what she had: she freely broke that expensive alabaster flask of fragrant oil to anoint Jesus, while everyone around her was staring at her. These people did not understand why she had done so, and even rebuked her for her action. Yet Jesus praised her because she understood the Savior’s heart. Other such examples from the Bible include Abigail who counseled David and prevented him from doing harm to others in his anger, the Canaanite servant girl who advised Naaman to seek help from the Israelite prophet, and Dorcas who cared for those whom nobody wanted to care for. All these people made use of the opportunity to do something for the Lord while they were able. For this reason, God remembered and blessed them. So, let us “remember now [our] Creator in the days of [our] youth, [b]efore the difficult days come” (Eccl 12:1), and seize each opportunity to serve God. Let us serve Him to the best of our ability, no matter how great or small our task may be—for we all can do something for Jesus."

Tsai With what shall I come before God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, or with calves a year old? Will He be pleased with thousands of rams, or ten thousand rivers of oil? O man, He has shown you what is good and what He requires of you: to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God. - Micah God’s abundant grace naturally motivates man to seek His pleasure and approval with some form of offering or, at least, with a reciprocal gesture of gratitude. However, our God is the Creator of the universe who does not need anything. He gives to men life, breath, and all things. What can man ever present to Him? With this understanding, the Israelites during Prophet Micah’s time questioned: what can we offer to please God by whom all things are made? How about sacrificing thousands of rams or offering ten thousand rivers of oil? Their questions seem to suggest that God is difficult to please and that He would not even be contented with such a plethora of sacrifices—as if God would demand something beyond what they could afford. In response, God told them that they had been shown what is good and what He required of them: to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with Him. It is not about what we can contribute to God’s riches, since He lacks nothing. What He requires of us is simple—to be a person after His heart. It is more about ourselves than what we can do for Him. Today, we support the church’s work with monetary offerings and by serving with our talents. But does God delight in our service? Are these offerings and services all that He requires of us? The Bible repeatedly reminds us that it is not the scope of our service that pleases God, but the way we present ourselves to Him before rendering a service. God has enough of burnt offerings of rams and oil. If we do not offer ourselves as a living sacrifice and walk humbly with God, our service will be nothing more than the trampling of His courts, which is detestable to Him (Isa 1:11–15). Through interactions with His people, God has shown us what is good in His eyes. Through His law and the narratives of ancient saints, we are informed of what to do and what not to do. What He requires of us is to act accordingly, making the right choices in life. And this is to live justly. The Psalmist proclaims that “[r]ighteousness and justice are the foundation of God’s throne; [m]ercy and truth go before His face” (Ps 89:14). Justice and mercy are two attributes of God, and He wants His servants to imitate Him. This is easier said than done. To find favor in God’s eyes requires lifelong learning. The theme articles in this issue discuss how we can learn to fear and love God and respond to His requirements. May the Holy Spirit enlighten and guide us to walk humbly in His way to perfection."

What Are the Right Conditions for Prayer? It is helpful to set aside a time and place for prayer. Firstly, we need to find somewhere quiet so that we can concentrate. We note that Jesus did exactly this: He habitually withdrew into the wilderness to pray ( Lk 5:16). The purpose of a peaceful environment is to create the right conditions within our heart, such as inner quietness and devotion. Secondly, we should endeavour to pray at least three times a day (Ps 55:17; Dan 6:10). But, where necessary, we can pray anywhere—a silent prayer on the way to work or college, or a short prayer when we need God’s guidance, or simply to give thanks. Furthermore, Paul encourages us to pray in the Spirit: “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints” (Eph 6:18). When we pray in the Spirit, He intercedes for us in spiritual tongues that transcend the limitations of the human language: “Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God” (Rom 8:26–27). In short, when we pray in tongues, we have the confidence that the Holy Spirit will articulate our needs in the most appropriate way before God.

1,29300,Why Is the Lord's Prayer Important?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2014/Importance_of_Lords_Prayer_29300.htm,"Why Is the Lord’s Prayer Important? Why Is the Lord’s Prayer Important? The Lord’s Prayer is important because it is a model prayer given to us by Jesus (Mt 6:9; Lk 11:2). When we reflect upon the words recorded in Matthew 6:9–13, we gain some important teachings about our relationship with God and the priorities of life: • “Our Father in heaven” (v. 9). This opening address reminds us that we are praying to God, who is our Father in heaven. We call Him “Father” because we are born of Him ( Jn 1:12–13), He adopted us as His children (Gal 4:5; Eph 1:5), and He has poured out the Spirit of His Son into our hearts (Gal 4:6). Hence, we should fear Him: “And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your sojourning here in fear” (1 Pet 1:17). The words also remind us that our true home is in heaven and, for now, we are merely pilgrims in this world (Heb 11:13–16; 1 Pet 2:11). One day, Jesus will return to take us to our Father in heaven ( Jn 14:2–3; 20:17). • “Hallowed be Your name” (v. 9). These words teach us to revere God’s name (Rev 15:4), which is “holy and awesome” (Ps 111:9). Today, believers and unbelievers alike often profane God’s name: believers do it when they sin and dishonor God ( Prov 30:9; 1 Tim 6:1); unbelievers do it when they blaspheme God’s name, His church and His followers (Rev 13:6). • “Your kingdom come” (v. 10). Jesus began His ministry by proclaiming, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mt 4:17; cf. Mk 1:15). Where is God’s kingdom? Firstly, Jesus tells us it “is not of this world” ( Jn 18:36). He says, “For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you” ( Lk 17:21). In other words, God’s kingdom is where He rules: it is both in heaven and within submissive hearts. As Christians, we should pray each day for God’s kingdom to be revealed and to joyfully anticipate the Lord’s second coming, when we shall enter that everlasting place (2 Pet 1:11). • “Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (v. 10). The Bible says that God’s purpose never changes (Heb 6:17) and that no one can hinder His will (Dan 4:35). Those who help to accomplish His will are the angels in heaven (Ps 103:20–21) and the believers on earth. However, because Satan is constantly trying to obstruct His work, and believers often fail to submit to His will, we need to pray that God’s will be done here on earth, as it is in heaven. Importantly, we should ask Him to fill us “with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding” (Col 1:9) so that we can implement it (Mt 7:21). • “Give us today our daily bread” (v. 11). God understands our needs (Mt 6:8, 32). Therefore, when we ask Him for our daily bread, He will answer us. Moreover, by asking, we acknowledge that everything comes from Him and that we are sustained by His grace. God says, “For the world is Mine, and all its fullness” (Ps 50:12). Asking God to give us our daily bread also reminds us of a number of important biblical teachings related to Christian living: * “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you” (Mt 6:33). * “...Let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need” (Eph 4:28). * “That you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you, that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may lack nothing” (1 Thess 4:11–12). * “And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content” (1 Tim 6:8; cf. Prov 30:8–9). * “Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you” ( Lk 6:38). * “...It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’” (Mt 4:4; cf. Deut 8:3). * “Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him” ( Jn 6:27). • “And forgive us our debts” (v. 12). We all have weaknesses; hence, even after water baptism, we may still commit wrongs, which can be likened to accruing debts before God. Elder James points out that merely failing to do what we know is right constitutes a sin ( Jas 4:17). Therefore, he teaches us to confess our sins before God and to ask for forgiveness (1 Jn 1:7, 9). Thereafter, we should strive to do the “good works” that God has purposed for us and to be fruitful (Eph 2:10; Col 1:10; Tit 2:14). • “As we forgive our debtors” (v. 12). It is the Lord’s will that we forgive one another (Mt 6:14–15; 18:21–35; Mk 11:25–26). “Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do” (Col 3:12–13); “And above all things have fervent love for one another, for ‘love will cover a multitude of sins’” (1 Pet 4:8). • “And do not lead us into temptation” (v. 13). The Bible is clear that God would never tempt us or lead us to sin ( Jas 1:13). For this reason, we take these words to be a request to God to save us from falling into sin (Mt 26:41; cf. Rom 1:24; Gal 6:1). In another sense, “temptations” [1] can refer to the trials of life. We can ask God to protect us amidst life’s challenges, so that we do not depart from Him or do anything that compromises our faith. And when we ask, we can be assured of His help: “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Cor 10:13). • “But deliver us from the evil one” (v. 13). There are many reasons to ask God to deliver us from the evil one, including the latter’s wish to make us fall. But the devil can only work if we fail to curb our weaknesses: “But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death” ( Jas 1:14–15). For this reason, we should ask God to strengthen us, so that we can obey Him, rather than our own desires. In this way, the devil will have no room to work: “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you” ( Jas 4:7). • Aside from leading us to sin, the devil may also try to attack us: to harm us physically or mentally, especially while we are serving God. We can see this from the life of Paul who had to face relentless persecutions. After being tried by the authorities on one occasion, he declared, “And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly kingdom...” (2 Tim 4:17–18). Hence, he offers us these words of comfort: “But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one” (2 Thess 3:3). • “For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever” (v. 13). These concluding words remind us that, as Christians, our citizenship is in heaven (Phil 3:20). One day, we will reign with the Lord in His kingdom (2 Tim 2:12; Rev 22:5). • The Lord’s Prayer ends with Amen [2] (v. 13), a Greek word transliterated from Hebrew, meaning “verily” or “so let it be”. In saying this, we affirm the sincerity of our prayer and ask God to fulfill it. Source: Q&A on Biblical Doctrines (True Jesus Church, 2012) [1] Greek, peirasmos . Strong’s reference no. G3986.

1,31105,The Holy Communion Sacrament—What Is It All About?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2015/m75_ds_uk_ffchong_holycommunion_7_31105.htm,"The Holy Communion Sacrament—What Is It All About? The Holy Communion Sacrament—What Is It All About? FF Chong—London, U.K. A sacrament is defined as follows: · it is a practice instituted by the Lord Jesus Himself; · it is directly related to receiving salvation; · Jesus explicitly commanded His disciples to practice it. The True Jesus Church has three sacraments, and these are entirely based on the teachings of Christ and the apostles. The Holy Communion is one of these. There are two parts to this sacrament. Paul referred to the cup as ""the communion of the blood of Christ"" and the bread as ""the communion of the body of Christ"" (1 Cor 10:16). The Greek word for communion has the meaning of ""having fellowship, participating, and sharing."" The use of the term − the Lord's Supper − to refer to the Holy Communion is found only in 1 Corinthians 11:20. Other terms are the Lord's Table (from 1 Cor 10:21), and the Eucharist (from the Greek word for ""giving thanks""; Lk 22:17, 19; 1 Cor 11:24). Some believe that the expression “breaking of bread” (Acts 2:42, 46; 20:7, 11) probably refers to receiving the Lord's Supper with a common meal known as the Love Feast (2 Pet 2:13; Jude 12). ORIGIN The institution of the Lord's Supper (Mt 26:17–30; Mk 14:12–26; Lk 22:1–23; 1 Cor 11:23–25) took place on the night before Jesus died, at a meal commonly known as the Last Supper. Some have suggested that the Last Supper may have been the Jewish Passover meal, first instituted by God in the days of Moses (Ex 12:1–14; Num 9:1–5), although there continues to be considerable debate over this. What is indisputable, however, is that the Lord’s Supper was instituted at the time of the Passover feast (Lk 22:17). Jesus is the Paschal Lamb (1 Cor 5:7). Instituting the Holy Communion during the Passover feast typifies the suffering and death of Jesus. The slaughter of a lamb on the Passover was intended to save God’s people from being killed together with the Egyptian firstborn. The angel of destruction passed over all the blood-marked houses. Peace, protection, and redemption were thus produced by the sacrifice of the lamb. Analogously, Jesus’ death frees us from the snare of death. THE BODY AND BLOOD OF JESUS Jesus’ words about the Holy Communion, recorded in the three Gospels, put beyond any shadow of doubt that the bread and cup are truly His body and His blood (Mt 26:26–29; Mk 14:22–24; Lk 22:19–20). Paul confirmed that he directly received the teachings on the Holy Communion from the Lord (1 Cor 11:23). What he shared with the church in Corinth was basically a reiteration of Christ’s teachings on the Holy Communion (1 Cor 11:24–25). Hence, the words of Christ and the teaching of Paul were completely consistent with one another. In other words, it was never a problem for the Gospel writers and the apostles to understand exactly what Jesus taught. However, after the turn of the first century, especially after the demise of all the apostles, the church began to have deep problems understanding the truth on the Holy Communion. With the departure of the Spirit from the church, different schools of thoughts rapidly sprang up, producing complex explanations, which obscured the essence of the Lord’s teachings. These varying concepts include Transubstantiation and Consubstantiation . Transubstantiation, a concept used in Roman Catholic theology, is the change of “bread and wine,” in substance, into the flesh and blood of Christ, even though the elements appear to remain the same. Consubstantiation was the concept developed by Martin Luther who believed that Christ's body and blood are truly present ""in, with, and under"" the bread and wine. However, the elements do not actually change into Christ's body and blood. So, how do we explain the mystery of the Holy Communion? Physically and visibly, the bread and cup (juice) remain unchanged after the consecration. But in the Spirit, the bread and juice are respectively the body and the blood of Jesus. The key difference between the True Jesus Church’s view and those of others stems from the understanding of the work of the Holy Spirit: “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The word that I speak to you is “Spirit and life” (Jn 6:63). In the True Jesus Church’s view, it is the Spirit that makes the difference—without the presence of the Spirit, no transformation would occur; and it is in the Spirit, that these ordinary elements become the body and blood of Christ. When we believe and follow exactly what the Bible teaches, we allow the Spirit to work; He thus gives us spiritual life through our physical participation in the Holy Communion. This can be further explained by using the example of baptism. During baptism, the water remains physically as water. However, with the presence of the Holy Spirit, when the baptismal mode is adhered to, blood in the water is availed for the forgiveness of sins. It is the abiding presence of the Spirit that transforms sacraments, achieving the necessary spiritual effects when these sacraments are performed physically in strict adherence to the teachings of the Bible. PARTAKING OF THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF JESUS After conversion, we are given a new lease of life. By partaking of the body and blood of Christ, this life grows unto eternity. However, the extension from temporal to eternal is only made possible by the working of the Spirit. Critically, we must respond to the Spirit’s work by keeping ourselves holy in the Lord while waiting for His second coming. Doing this extends our life after physical death. Remaining in the Lord with the help of His Spirit, we will be raised on the last day to receive eternal life (Jn 6:53–57, 61–63). This is why Jesus says, whoever eats His flesh and drinks His blood shall have eternal life (Jn 6:54). Partaking of the Holy Communion also enables us to abide in the Lord—“He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in Him” (Jn 6:56). There are three parts to this relationship. The Bible tells us that Jesus has given us His life. In reality, this act of giving is achieved by the Spirit when we partake of His flesh and blood. The inseparable relationship that we have with Christ is reflected in the life we now live; our life is the very life of Christ and is Christ Himself. By partaking of the Holy Communion, we feed on Jesus. We live His life because He is alive in us (Jn 6:57–58). Through the incessant work of the Spirit in us, our lives are constantly energized and sustained by keeping the word in our hearts. Partaking of the Holy Communion is, on our part, a conscious choice to abide in Him. Remaining in Him requires us to keep the truth, which then enhances the abiding presence of the Spirit in our life (Jn 15:7). Essentially, practicing the word in all conceivable aspects of life is to imitate the life that Christ lived while He was in this world. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HOLY COMMUNION The Holy Communion is a constant reminder of the death of Christ. There are two key aspects that we must remember. One is the great love of Christ demonstrated by His unconditional sacrifice of His life (Rom 5:6–11). It was no mere physical death that He suffered (Mt 10:28; Lk 12:49–50; Mt 16:21; Jn 12:23–25; Heb 10:5; Mt 20:28). Instead, it involved the excruciating experience of being deserted by God while shouldering the sins of humanity (Heb 2:9). Such saving love is beyond anyone’s ability to repay. The second aspect concerns how—knowing that He has so willingly died for our sins—we should always live for Him and not for ourselves. The knowledge of His unconditional sacrifice should be an internal geyser, propelling those who truly fear and resolutely remain in Him to faithfully serve Him in the way He wants us to. Like Paul (cf. Gal 2:20–21), by partaking of the Holy Communion in truth and in Spirit, we are invigorated and more motivated than before to better ourselves to fulfill the divine purpose that He has for us and His church. So, what exactly is that purpose? In his message to the church in Corinth, Paul declares succinctly and powerfully: “We proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes” (1 Cor 11:26). The most direct and important message from this timeless reminder is our commission to reach out to the unbelieving world. Evangelism must always remain the top priority on the long list of church work. Nothing can or should ever replace it. In all circumstances, the church must remain focused on spreading the complete gospel of salvation entrusted to her. WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PARTAKE? The Holy Communion after consecration is the body and the blood of Christ. The sanctified bread is the body (1 Cor 11:24) in the Spirit. The body of Christ is the church. This fact naturally disqualifies those who are not baptized from sharing the bread since they are not members of the body of Christ. Jesus also says that the cup is the New Covenant in His blood (1 Cor 11:25), which He has shed for the forgiveness of sins (Mt 26:28). For a non-baptized person, his sins are not forgiven, which makes it unacceptable for him to partake of the Holy Communion. In addition, partaking of the Holy Communion imparts eternal life (Jn 6:54), which is only possible once we have been made alive with Christ. When a person undergoes a correctly-performed baptism, with the presence of the Spirit, he is raised from spiritual death (Rom 6:3–5; 8:11). In the light of Christ’s sacrificial work, it would thus be inconsistent to permit a person who is not baptized to partake of the Holy Communion, since he has not even chosen to be in Christ by accepting the one correct baptism. Solemnity is the most appropriate tone for sacraments, especially one in which the great sacrifice of Christ is commemorated. Those who partake of the Holy Communion are asked to examine themselves—another indication that the Holy Communion cannot be partaken in a casual or flippant way. According to the teaching of Paul, anyone who partakes of the Holy Communion in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord (1 Cor 11:27). Prior to partaking, forgiveness of sins is to be sought to ensure the wrath of God will not be poured upon us. The telling examples in Corinth serve as a stern warning—some became sick and even died because they took the Holy Communion lightly (1 Cor 11:30). Based on Paul’s above teaching, it is biblically sound to forbid those who have committed mortal sins from taking the Holy Communion. A person who has committed a mortal sin has cut himself off from the life of Christ and from His body, the church. Would it be right for one who has chosen to turn his back on Christ to partake of the body and blood of Christ? Doing so would be tantamount to treating the body and blood of Christ as common (cf. Heb 10:29) and not giving due reverence to Christ’s sacrifice. This would be a profanity in the eyes of God. CONCLUSION The partaking of the Holy Communion goes beyond the physicality of the ritual. We partake of the flesh and blood of Christ in the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit. The life imparted in partaking of the Holy Communion is eternal and only given to those within the church. Those who are joined to the body of Christ through baptism (1 Cor 12:12; Gal 3:27) are raised from spiritual death. They have been transferred from the domain of darkness into the kingdom of light and are completely liberated from the inextricable grip of sin. They are thus eligible to share in the life of Christ by partaking of the Holy Communion. As partakers, we should not only reciprocate Jesus’ love with thanksgiving. Since we have been delivered from destruction, our span of life on earth must always reflect God’s purpose for individuals and the church as a whole. This means that, on a personal level, the will to live for God in holiness and the commitment to serve faithfully should always be our chief priority. On a collective front, the church has been commissioned to preach the gospel to every nook and corner of the world in all circumstances. Summoning every ounce of strength to do this work well is perhaps the least the church can do to repay the immeasurable love of Christ."
1,32668,Why Can’t the Clock Stop Ticking?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2016/m78_re_my_achair_whycan'ttheclock_6_web_32668.htm,"ACquila Anon— Malaysia The second hand of the clock in the study moves on steadily and inexorably, tick, tick, tick … as the seconds roll by in the wee hours …. As non-spiritual thoughts crowd and cloud my mind, I make a feeble attempt to snap myself out of this reverie, trying to salvage what little time is left in the day. How did the time that I had so carefully set aside to do God’s things once again slip away? Suddenly, the words of the Preacher in Ecclesiastes 3:1–15 flood my mind. This passage is particularly poignant for those of us who have to battle the crushing pressures of the hectic twenty-first century. Time is a precious commodity that seems to be very easily “eaten up,” especially the time we have set aside for productive and spiritual things. Everything today seems to move at what Bill Gates called “the speed of thought.” So much has to be crammed into twenty-four hours—our careers, business development, social appointments, the children’s punishing schedules, and some “me” or down time. Technology has helped speed up some tasks for us, but it has also stirred our seemingly insatiable appetites for social networking and the corresponding tasks to be ""updated"" or to garner “likes,” as well as for mindless hours of Internet trawling. In the construct of our little worlds, ever increasing numbers of activities jostle for priority. Sadly, one constant always seems to lose out in the battle for our time—a time for God. REGAIN THE SIMPLE FAITH LOST IN A COMPLEX WORLD Have we ever wondered why, in our journey of faith today, we seem to lack the purpose and conviction of our forefathers? Or why we are so easily distracted from focusing on what is important for our spiritual life? Ironically, amidst the complexity of our daily secular routines, we have lost the simplicity of faith and implicit entrustment in God, essential to building up our spirituality. For example, as our friends send their children for a myriad of enrichment classes, we worry that we would be depriving our children of a good future if we do not do the same. So Sabbath keeping, church camps or even Religious Education classes get lower priority than tuition, enrichment activities and piano/ballet/computer classes. How many of us have sacrificed and staked the importance of religious upbringing in place of some secular activity, which we justify will advance the paths of our children? Unknowingly, we have staked our children’s spiritual well-being and bartered away time that was to be set aside for God in a nonchalant fashion. Will the Lord indeed bless such endeavors? Cunning old Satan jumps straight on to these insecurities of ours, causing us to feel that we have to plan and spend our time to achieve all those markers of success that our peers have. Even more ironically, we always charge our smartphones and tablets to keep them topped up and running, yet we cannot seem to find the equivalent time to recharge our spiritual life. We just comfort ourselves with the aphorism that “God helps those who help themselves.” In fact, the presence of these so called “smart devices” is yet another diabolical plan to suck up and waste this precious commodity of God’s time for time-consuming activities such as social networking and Internet trawling. As we attend services, while using our Bible and hymn apps on our devices (convenience we say), have we “inadvertently” tapped on Facebook or WhatsApp? How many of us have “wandered” into the realm of cyberspace in the midst of observing one hour of service time? TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON But the Preacher, with a lifetime of experience and wisdom from God, firmly declares: To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven. A time to be born, … a time to plant, … a time to break down, and a time to build up, … a time to keep silence, and a time to speak. (Eccl 3:1–3, 7) A time for every purpose under heaven is a timely reminder that we must always find time for God; time to seek things everlasting, work on our spirituality, and mend the breaches in our wall of faith . Amidst the pressures of twenty-first century living, which often leave us floundering like a fish out of water, we need to regain and maintain the simple belief that we must seek first the kingdom of God. Jesus’ promise that “all these things will be added to you” will naturally follow. Remember that in His love, God gives us all the things we need, not all the things we want (cf. Rom 8:28; Jas 1:17). TREASURE TIME While time is beyond the control of any man, the use of time isn’t. We have lengthened our bucket list of materialistic things to acquire and worldly dreams to fulfill for a better tomorrow, which is why we find our time for spiritual pursuit ever-shrinking. Often exhausted by this incessant secular marathon, we seek to recharge through even more time-wasting and spirit-draining worldly leisure. At this point, we must reflect on Ecclesiastes 3:9— “What profit has the worker from that in which he labors?” Endeavoring to be the masters of our own destiny, we strategize and toil. But what do we have to show for the expended time and effort? Even if we lived to a hundred, dying in the luxury of our palatial homes, with the best healthcare that money can buy and surrounded by a multitude of family, what can we make of our life on earth? Let us refer to the wise men from the Old Testament: Jacob, patriarch of Israel, who had spent much of his life scheming and strategizing, declared to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers ” (Gen 47:9). Moses—ex-Prince of Egypt—confirms this, saying, “Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away” (Ps 90:10). Solomon—famed for wisdom and wealth—breaks the bad news: “No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them” (Eccl 1:11). The time we have wasted cannot be regained. We can only move forward and resolve to number our days to gain a heart of wisdom (Ps 90:12). Start to live our life with eternity in mind, not just the things of the materialistic world. Rekindle our first love for Him by once again putting the Lord as a priority in our life, getting rid of the distractions and time-consuming activities that sap away our spiritual well-being. For a start, put away our smart devices during service time; stop deceiving ourselves that these gadgets are but a tool to worship God. If anything, they put us on the path of temptation to draw us away from God. Stop giving ourselves excuses or making excuses for (or on behalf of) our children. Stand on the side of righteousness. What is wrong can never be made right by human design or justification. To illustrate, no manner of “work requirements” for us or betterment classes for our children, taking away what little time we have left to worship God and from keeping the Holy Sabbath, will make things right in the eyes of our Lord. Choose God, and He will lead us the way. Walk in reverence and obedience in His pathway, and He will provide. PRIORITIZE AND REDEEM TIME Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. (Eph 5:15–16) Apostle Paul reminds us to seize every opportunity to be wise stewards of time and keep a constant vigil on how we allocate our time. Make good use of opportune moments to advance our faith and spirituality. Look to Jesus as our role model for time management. Most importantly, in the midst of a busy life, find time to seek God in quiet solitude, meditation, and prayer to recharge, as Jesus Christ did. Let the clock stand still, in our moments of seeking, reflection and prayer, as we gain the strength and the means to overcome this testy trial of time that has descended on us in this age. CONCLUSION Ecclesiastes 3:15b gives a solemn reminder that “God requires an account of what is past.” This is certainly a very sobering thought indeed. Do not think that we can escape accountability for our actions and deeds and that there is no need to answer or to pay for our past wrongdoings. Far from that, we will have to give account of ourselves and our actions. Standing before the Lord God, will we be able to say to our master, “You gave me five talents [of time].

These words came true not long after the early church was established, for we learn of people like Simon the sorcerer who attracted a great following in Samaria and was acclaimed as “the great power of God” (Acts 8:10). However, even Simon converted to Christ and was baptized; then, it was his turn to be amazed by the power of God (Acts 8:13). False prophets and christs make use of the power of Satan to perform “signs and lying wonders” to deceive and confuse people (2 Thess 2:9). However, these false miracles will not stand the test of time and will be revealed for what they are. God’s power always triumphs1just as it did when Moses prevailed over Pharaoh’s magicians (Ex 7:8-12) and when Elijah defeated the prophets of Baal (1 Kgs 18:20-39)."

1,34159,How does the baptism of the Holy Spirit benefit us?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2016/What does the Holy Spirit benefits us_34159.htm,"The baptism of the Holy Spirit benefits us in a number of ways: 1. Th e Holy Spirit effects our spiritual rebirth. Jesus says, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” ( Jn 3:5–6; see also Ezek 37:14). 2. The Holy Spirit seals us for salvation. Paul says, “In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory” (Eph 1:13–14). 3. The Holy Spirit sets us free. Paul says, “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death” (Rom 8:2); “Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” (2 Cor 3:17). 4. The Holy Spirit teaches us the truth. Jesus says, “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you” ( Jn 14-:26). Elder John says, “But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him” (1 Jn 2:27). Also, Paul tells us, “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God” (1 Cor 2:12). 5. The Holy Spirit strengthens us. Paul’s prayer for the church was that the members “be strengthened with might through [God’s] Spirit in the inner man” (Eph 3:16). And, should we experience persecution for the sake of our faith, we can take heart from Peter’s words: “If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you…” (1 Pet 4:14). 6. The Holy Spirit empowers us to witness for Jesus. The Lord has promised, “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:8). According to Paul, our testimony for Jesus is not “with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (1 Cor 2:4). 7. The Holy Spirit helps us to bear fruit. Th e Book of Galatians says, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control...” (Gal 5:22–23). 8. The Holy Spirit helps us to pray. The Bible encourages us to “[pray] in the Holy Spirit” ( Jude 20), and to “[pray] always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit” (Eph 6:18). The benefit is that “the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom 8:26). 9. The Holy Spirit bestows spiritual gifts. Paul says, There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit” (1 Cor 12:4); “But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills” (1 Cor 12:11). 10. The Holy Spirit comforts us. The early Christians were comforted by the Holy Spirit during trials: Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied” (Acts 9:31). Also, Paul’s earnest prayer for the church was that she “ abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit” (Rom 15:13). 11. The Holy Spirit sanctifies us. Paul says, “...But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God” (1 Cor 6:11; cf. Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 1:2). 12. The Holy Spirit gives us spiritual life. Paul says, “But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you” (Rom 8:11)."
1,34223,What Happened to Samson?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2018/4 what happened to samson_Jachin Chong_34223.htm,"Untitled Page Jachin—Singapore INTRODUCTION Samson is often called “the strongest man to have ever lived.” He was a man born for greatness, but as we know, his life was defined by failure rather than victory. Where did he go wrong? Let us take a look at three parts of his story: his birth, his downfall, and his redeeming final moment of faith. SAMSON’S BIRTH Background The story of Samson is recorded in the Book of Judges. During Israel’s early history, the judges did not sit in a court of law. They led the Israelites into war against their oppressors and, for judges such as Deborah, settled disputes as a mediator between two parties. However, Samson did neither of these things. Samson was a very different judge, and his life story is unique. Not only is he the twelfth and final judge recorded in the Book of Judges, his story (recorded in chapters 13 to 16) is also given more space than any other judge. Most pertinently, he was specially chosen by God before his birth to deliver the Israelites. The birth of Samson Samson’s birth was a miracle. Manoah’s wife was infertile, but the Angel of the Lord appeared to her and announced the birth of Samson, as well as the manner of his life (Judg 13:2–5). He would be a Nazirite from birth, and his hair was to remain uncut. Numbers 6:1–21 describes the Nazirite vow in detail. It could be taken by any Israelite man or woman for a predetermined amount of time. During the period of the vow, a Nazirite was forbidden to cut his hair, drink wine, and to have anything to do with the grapevine, from the seed to the skin. A Nazirite was not allowed to touch a dead body—if he did, he would have to purify himself and re-start the period of his vow. These processes might seem very troublesome on first reading, but that is the exact purpose of the Nazirite vow. God wanted the Israelites to learn total and absolute consecration to Him. The Angel who foretold Samson’s birth repeated God’s instructions from Numbers 6, but with two important differences. First, Manoah’s wife was to also abstain from unclean foods (Judg 13:4). This instruction was given explicitly because Israel had fallen into such a bad state that eating unclean food was deemed socially acceptable. Second, unlike a normal Nazirite vow, Samson’s Nazirite status was to last a lifetime. Even though Samson was to be consecrated his entire life, he failed to adopt the Nazirite lifestyle. He would, instead, pursue the pleasures of the flesh. Were Manoah and his wife godly parents? We may wonder why Samson failed to live out his Nazirite status—perhaps his parents were ungodly and failed to raise him according to God’s instructions. But Judges 13:8 tells us otherwise. Manoah was absent when the Angel appeared to his wife, so he prayed to God to re-send the Angel to teach them how to raise the child. He asked, “What will be the boy’s rule of life, and his work?” (Judg 13:12b). We see that this couple cared how Samson was to be raised. How many of us would actually pray to God asking what we should do for our child, or what our child's rule of life will be? The time of the judges was a dark age for Israel , as they had fallen into the vicious cycle of sin. Whenever the people’s lives became comfortable, they would turn to sin and idolatry. God would then punish them, prompting them to call out to Him. Each time, God would deliver them from their oppressors, only for them to sin again. Samson was born during another of these sinful periods, for “[a]gain the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD” (Judg 13:1a). Furthermore, Manoah belonged to the tribe of Dan, a tribe that stands out as one of the least faithful to God. Judges 1 records that many Israelite tribes failed to drive out the Canaanites from the land, as God had commanded. But the Danites fared worse than the rest—they themselves were driven back into the mountains by the Amorites (Judg 1:34). Another incident is recorded in Judges 18, where the Danites took the idols of Micah’s house and worshipped them as if they were the Lord God of Israel. In the midst of Israel’s spiritual depravity, the Danites proved to be the weakest in faith. Yet, here is a Danite couple who was intent on going against the grain. Manoah prayed to the Lord, enquired about how to raise the boy, and, with his wife, offered a young goat with the grain offering to the Lord (Judg 13:8, 12, 19). If we consider the godless times in which Samson’s parents lived, and the fact that they had every intention to raise the child according to the Angel’s instructions, we can infer that they were, indeed, godly parents. God’s blessings and abidance Not only was Samson born into a godly household, God was also with him as he grew up: “So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. And the Spirit of the LORD began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol” (Judg 13:24–25; emphasis added). God was with Samson so that he could consecrate and dedicate his life as a Nazirite for the work of God, to fulfill his calling. At this point of the story, Samson was a man whose birth had been twice announced by the Angel, he was consecrated by God as a Nazirite from his mother’s womb, brought up by godly parents, and blessed by God’s movement. Could a servant of God have asked for more? In fact, the root word for the name Samson means “sun,” which is apt for a man who was to shine as bright as the sun, and had all he needed to accomplish this. But why did he fail so spectacularly? SAMSON’S DOWNFALL As Samson’s story unfolds, we see a man dedicated not to his calling, but to satisfying his flesh. One example of this is when he attempted to marry a Philistine woman in Timnah. In Judges 14:1–4, Samson told his father, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.” Of course, Samson’s godly parents objected to his demands, but their objections fell on deaf ears. Samson was adamant: “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.” The New Living Translation [1] translates this as, “Get her for me! She looks good to me.” When Samson later spoke to her, again, he was well pleased (Judg 14:7). Samson was clearly a man of the flesh. It did not matter that God had forbidden the Israelites from marrying the Canaanites (Deut 7:3–4). Worse still, his consecration as a Nazirite meant nothing to him. Samson saw what he liked and took it. He did whatever was good in his own eyes—the same pair of eyes that would be gouged out at the end of his story. Honey in the lion’s carcass On the journey down to Timnah, a young lion attacked Samson out of nowhere (Judg 14:4–6). Of course, Samson would not be deterred, and God’s word that he would eventually deliver the Israelites would surely come to pass. The Spirit of God came upon Samson and, for the first time, we read of his incredible strength—he tore the lion from limb to limb. He then rejoined his parents as if nothing had happened. Some time later, he returned to see what had happened to the lion’s carcass, perhaps to admire his own handiwork (Judg 14:8–9). He found a bee nest inside the carcass, and took some honey to eat. He then gave some to his parents without informing them where it had come from. Now, let us remind ourselves that the Israelites were forbidden from eating anything unclean. The lion was an unclean animal, and anyone who touched the carcass of an unclean animal would be defiled (Lev 11:24–28). An unclean animal could not defile an Israelite while it was still alive, but when it died, whatever came in contact with it would also become unclean (Judg 11:32). Hence, the honey from the lion’s carcass was unclean. Samson not only defiled himself, but his parents too. Worse, Samson and his mother had been explicitly prohibited by God from eating anything unclean. But Samson did not consider any of these things. The sweetness of the honey outweighed the fact that he would be defiled by the carcass. The image of the honey in the lion’s carcass neatly encapsulates the phrase “the passing pleasures of sin” (Heb 11:25). Sin is like the lion’s carcass that defiles, but it also has its moments of pleasure, like the taste of honey. This represents Samson’s fatal flaw: he would always choose to eat sweet honey over preserving his holiness. Throughout his life, he did not concern himself with keeping to the restrictions of the Nazirite vow. In fact, he never chose to be a Nazirite, it was forced upon him from birth. He was a Nazirite by name, but not in spirit. Samson’s literary gift Although Samson was immensely blessed by God, he only used God’s gifts to satisfy his own desires. In fact, Samson was not only blessed with brute strength, but also with a gift for words. He posed this riddle to the Philistines: “Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet” (Judg 14:14). Clearly, Samson had the brains and the brawn. Later, he composed another poem on the spot after killing a thousand Philistines: “ With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!” (Judg 15:16) What is poignant here is that God blessed Samson with such potential. Samson could have been a much greater man—perhaps even a precursor to David, the sweet Psalmist of Israel. But unlike David, who used his literary gift to compose psalms to praise God, Samson used his gift for his own ends. He posed the riddle to the Philistines to win himself thirty sets of clothing. And he composed the poem not to praise God for giving him a miraculous victory, but to glorify himself for killing a thousand men with only a donkey’s jawbone. Did God cause Samson to fall in love with the Philistine woman? When the Bible describes Samson’s desire to marry the Philistine woman, it adds: “But his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD—that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines” (Judg 14:4). Hence, one might ask, is this entire incident from God? Actually, we have to understand that God did not approve of Samson’s actions. Rather, God was using Samson’s freely made decisions to fulfill His will. Indeed, God had told Manoah’s wife that Samson would deliver the Israelites. However, Samson was not like Moses, who was moved to deliver the Israelites when he saw them suffering. Samson simply acted on his desires impulsively. He wanted to marry the Philistine woman because he was attracted to her. He posed the riddle because he wanted thirty sets of clothing for free. He killed thirty Philistines in Ashkelon because he was angry that he had lost the wager and had to pay up. He set the Philistines’ fields on fire because his father-in-law had given his wife to his best man. He killed yet more Philistines because they had burned his wife and her father. Everything he did was based on the flesh and on impulse. In fact, he had every intention of marrying the Philistine woman, but God would not allow him to consummate the marriage. As a result, Samson grew angry, and Samson killed. Through this, Samson delivered the Israelites and fulfilled the will of God. The spiritual decline of Samson From a spiritual viewpoint, Samson had complete disregard for the word of God. Throughout his life, he only pursued Philistine women, those whom God had expressly forbidden the Israelites from marrying. In Timnah, Samson was unwilling to marry any Israelite, but was adamant on marrying a Philistine woman just because she “looked good” to him. Later, he saw a prostitute in Gaza and paid to sleep with her (Judg 16:1). Finally, he fell in love with Delilah, and lived with her out of wedlock. Samson had no qualms with defiling his body, whether it was paying a prostitute or cohabiting with Delilah, to satisfy his fleshly desires. This failure to resist the honey in the lion’s carcass ultimately led to his demise. As far as his Nazirite status was concerned, Samson violated one restriction after another with wanton disregard. He ate unclean food—the honey from the lion’s carcass. He also threw a wedding feast at Timnah, where it is likely that he drank wine (in Hebrew, the root word for “feast” is, literally, “drink.”) Now, the only Nazirite restriction left unbroken was the prohibited cutting of hair. And this is the area where he played dangerously close to the edge. Going to the edge In Judges 16, we read that the Philistines paid Delilah to seduce Samson. Indeed, she asked him directly about the source of his power, saying, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and with what you may be bound to afflict you” (Judg 16:6). Samson must have realized what Delilah was doing, because each time he disclosed his supposed weakness, she would use it to try to subdue him and allow the Philistines to attack. And yet, Samson was not concerned; he continued to play with fire by engaging with Delilah’s game. He did not realize that he was drawing closer and closer to the edge. First he said “bind me with seven fresh bowstrings” (Judg 16:7); then, “bind me securely with new ropes” (v. 11); then, “weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom” (v. 13). He finally caved in and confessed, “If I am shaven, then my strength will leave me” (v. 17). This was the straw that broke the camel’s back. When the Philistines attacked, Samson did not realize that he was powerless, and that God had already departed from him (v. 20). It is just as the proverb warns: “Can a man take fire to his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?” (Prov 6:27) When it comes to sin, man likes to play with fire. We like to go to the edge and test the boundaries, thinking that we can always turn back in time. With regards to sexual sin, some believers go to the edge without thinking of the consequences. It is only after they have indulged their flesh that they ask, “Is this a mortal sin?” Unfortunately, some go so close to the edge that they inadvertently fall off. They realize, too late, that the Lord has already departed from them. This is what happened to Samson—he lived his life so close to the edge that he fell off, and the Lord departed from him. THE SILVER LINING IN SAMSON’S LIFE Finally, we come to the last part of Samson’s life—the silver lining of his story. His sins had finally caught up with him, and the very eyes he had lived to satisfy had been blinded by his enemies. He had used God’s strength for his own purposes, and now he had to use his own strength to work as a grinder in prison. He had always gratified his flesh and its desires, but now he had to indulge the desires of the Philistines by performing for them. Yet, Samson was like the man Jesus healed, who said, “[T]hough I was blind, now I see” (Jn 9:25b). Samson’s physical eyes were blind, but his spiritual sight was finally clear. When the author of Hebrews lists down the Old Testament heroes of faith, Samson is included (Heb 11:32). Some find it puzzling that Samson is mentioned, while others explain it away by saying that he demonstrated some faith throughout his life. But let us not forget, Samson was able to achieve his final victory only because God answered his prayer. Samson called out: “O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray! Strengthen me, I pray, just this once, O God, that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes” (Judg 16:28). As Isaiah says, it is our iniquities that separate us from God (Isa 59:2). Samson’s sins had alienated him from God. Would God have answered his final prayer if Samson had not truly repented? The same God who had left Samson in the Valley of Sorek would again strengthen him, one last time. With one push, Samson brought down the temple of Dagon and killed 3,000 Philistines, including many prominent leaders. This victory was to be Samson’s greatest, but it was also his last. He died along with the Philistines. And after a lifetime of living with the Philistines, Samson was brought back to his own people to be buried in his father’s tomb (Judg 16:31). Samson’s end reveals to us the power of God’s forgiveness. The greatest victory lies in overcoming our past sins, and repenting with a broken and contrite heart (Ps 51:17). For this is when God hears and answers our prayer. CONCLUSION Samson is like the worker who “will be saved, yet as through fire” (1 Cor 3:15b). The conclusion of Samson’s story is tinged with sadness. We see his unfulfilled potential, like so many athletes who show brilliant talent in their youth, but indulge in the party lifestyle and fizzle out before their prime. Samson was a man who simply indulged his flesh, used God’s gifts for himself, and trampled his Nazirite calling. He could have accomplished so much for God, but his life ended with many regrets and what-ifs. He failed to live up to his name; he failed to shine as bright as the sun. The question for us to ponder is: What about us? Will our Christian life be one of regrets and tragic waste? Let us learn from Samson’s mistakes and seek to fulfill our potential. If we embrace our calling and use our gifts to shine for God, then we can do mighty and victorious works for Him.

The Bible records: “Then Jesus, when He had been baptized, came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, ‘This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased’ ” (Mt 3:16-17). John the Baptist witnessed this event and testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him…And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God” ( Jn 1:32, 34).

As it is, we have been blessed with a double hope: the con fi dence of our spiritual resurrection through water baptism (Rom 6 : 4 ) and the anticipation of the resurrection of our bodies when Jesus comes again ( Jn 6 : 40 ). On account of Jesus’ resurrection, God has “bego tte n us again to a living hope” ( 1 Pet 1 : 3 ); we are justi fi ed (Rom 4 : 25 ); we are raised with Jesus and given spiritual life (Rom 8:10-11; Col 2:12-13); we “sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (Eph 2:6); God “will also raise us up by His power” (1 Cor 6:14)."

The bride-to-be asks her fiancé, “What sort of house are you going to buy me?” This is not an unusual question. But what if the bride-to-be is wealthy and already has everything she could want or need? This changes the context of the question completely; the house is no longer a necessity but serves as a token of love. When God posed this question to His chosen people, there was a similar implication: “ Heaven is My throne, And earth is My footstool. Where is the house that you will build Me? And where is the place of My rest?” (Isa 66:1) God has everything in His possession; what more can we offer Him? In recent years, the True Jesus Church has seen many places of worship spring up across the globe, as more congregations have acquired buildings for their worship and evangelism needs. Many see a newly built church as a sign of growth and an expression of the members’ devotion and commitment. However, the splendor of a church building does not directly correlate to the spirituality of its occupants. What matters to God are the hearts of the believers: “ For all those things My hand has made, And all those things exist,” Says the LORD. “ But on this one will I look: On him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, And who trembles at My word.” (Isa 66:2) When God’s nation prospers and the borders of His land expand, He is glorified (Isa 26:15). But is this purely a numbers game, represented by an increase in believers and churches, or is there more to it? Ultimately, in what ways should the church grow to bring glory to God? AN UNREALIZED PROMISE: THE GLORY OF THE LATTER TEMPLE SHALL BE GREATER When the exiled Jews returned to Jerusalem from Babylon, they endured much hardship and had meager resources with which to rebuild the temple. On its completion, God asked those who had survived the destruction in 586 B.C. to compare the new temple with Solomon’s temple. His question was rhetorical because the second temple obviously paled in comparison to the original (Hag 2:3). But it set the scene for a prophecy: the glory of the latter temple would be greater than the former. This was the promise of the Almighty God who would fill the temple with glory (Hag 2:5–8). As we know, the physical temple was eventually destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70, without God’s prophecy coming to pass. Instead, this prophecy was to be fulfilled spiritually in the coming of the church (1 Cor 3:16–17; Eph 2:20–22). But how would the latter temple be greater than the first, and to which epoch of church history does the prophecy refer? As mentioned above, Isaiah 66:1–2 shows that our hearts matter more to God than physical buildings. The people of God cannot find glory by their own means; God is their glory, just as He is glorified through His people (Isa 60:19, 21). They are the work of His hands, created in Christ Jesus for good works (Eph 2:8–10). When Jesus accomplished His work of salvation on earth, He was glorified and God was glorified in Him (Jn 13:31; 17:4). In the same vein, those who belong to Jesus bring glory to Him through their actions (Jn 17:10; 2 Thess 1:11–12). If we live a Christ-like life by demonstrating good works and godly nature, we showcase the glory of God. We are glorified in Him, and He in us. Does the glory of the latter temple refer to the apostolic church? Without a doubt, the apostolic church started with a bang when the Holy Spirit descended at Pentecost (Acts 2). As Jesus had prophesied, the kingdom of God was established with power (Mk 9:1). However, the church gradually became institutionalized and deviated from the truth as heresies crept in. The Holy Spirit eventually departed and no longer dwelled with the secularized church. Nevertheless, God’s will cannot be thwarted. The prophets Isaiah and Micah spoke of how the mountain of God’s house would be established and exalted above the hills (Isa 2:2–4; Mic 4:1–3). These prophecies point to the glory of the future church, to which all true believers will stream. This is realized in the True Jesus Church, which was established by the Lord Jesus through the Holy Spirit in the time of the latter rain, and is the restored apostolic church. However, by no stretch of the imagination could we describe the present church as having surpassed the glory of the apostolic church. During a recent spiritual convocation, a preacher cited the example of an exemplary church where brethren and truth-seekers gathered for a whole week to study the truth from morning to midnight. He also testified of a third-generation True Jesus Church member who rejuvenated his faith by joining a missionary trip to Africa. Witnessing God’s work firsthand inspired this brother to truly believe in God for the first time. We view these two examples as rare occurrences today, but such experiences were commonplace in the apostolic time. A cursory look at the early apostolic church, the model church, reveals what the glory of God looks like (Acts 2:40–47). The members were steadfast in the apostles’ doctrine; they continued daily with one accord and had everything in common so that no one lacked anything; they feared God and possessed gladness and simplicity of heart. As a result, God blessed them with wonders and signs, adding to their numbers daily. Many in the West, including True Jesus Church members, have never experienced events like those mentioned in the Book of Acts. To them, God is remote, only to be discovered in the distant past or in a far-off land. In the prophet Jeremiah’s time, he had to convince his countrymen that God was not just the God of Israel, but also the all-powerful God of the universe (Jer 23:23). Today, it is the reverse: we need to persuade our members that God is not just the ruler of the heavens far away, but is also nearby and personal. We can experience Him right here and now without the need to go abroad. So what is stopping us from knowing God intimately and being inspired to glorify Him through our actions? A LACK OF URGENCY The disciples truly believed that the second coming of Jesus would occur in their lifetime. Before Jesus’ ascension to heaven, they asked Him, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” (Acts 1:6). The imminence of God’s kingdom was never far from the apostles’ minds. Jesus preached that the kingdom of God was at hand and that some of the apostles would witness its arrival (Mk 1:15; 9:1). Paul wrote, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand” (Rom 13:12a), and even encouraged those who had wives to be “as though they had none” because time was short (1 Cor 7:29). Luke notes, before sharing the parable of the minas, that his contemporaries thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately (Lk 19:11). In hindsight, we know that their thinking was incorrect. But today, the pendulum has swung the other way. A branch of eschatology known as “realized eschatology” holds that the New Testament passages discussing the last days do not refer to the future, but to the rebirth of the world, instituted by Jesus’ ministry, and His lasting legacy. This line of thinking is attractive to liberal Christians who focus only on the love and goodness of God while disregarding His judgment. Such a view is contradictory to the Bible and the beliefs of the true church. However, some True Jesus Church believers behave as though they agree with this type of theology, going about their lives as though Jesus’ second coming will never happen. For them, now is the time to be rooted in the world. God can wait; the church can wait; spiritual cultivation can wait; and Christ’s second coming can wait. Such believers feel no sense of urgency whatsoever. What about ourselves? We often prioritize our life and work, and allocate any remaining time and energy to church. When our personal schedule clashes with the church timetable, it is usually our service to God that suffers. How many times have we skipped church services or rushed off early because of private or work engagements? Church projects are delayed and deadlines missed. Yet, we defend our actions by stating that we are mostly volunteers, after all. Surely, such delays are inevitable. This complacency is not new. When the exiles returned to Jerusalem, they busied themselves with building their own homes and livelihoods, while God’s house lay in ruins (Hag 1:4). Paul reminded the members to set their minds on things above (Col 3:2), knowing that those with families would always put the latter before God (1 Cor 7:33). John likewise exhorted believers, “Do not love the world” (1 Jn 2:15). We need to reset our life’s direction and reignite our zeal for the coming kingdom. Paul’s heavenly hope enabled him to experience the power of renewal (2 Cor 4:16). The early church was devoted to God’s teaching and fellowship (Acts 2:42, 46). Luke used the term προσκαρτερέω (proskartereó), which is translated as “devote, continuing, steadfast, persevere and be constantly diligent.” If we reawaken this desire to draw near to God (Jas 4:8), then God will manifest Himself to us, just as He did in the apostolic church. A LACK OF LOVE: SELF-CENTEREDNESS Jesus prophesied that the love of many would grow cold in the last days because of deception, betrayal, hate and the increase of lawlessness (Mt 24:4–12). Today, we constantly hear news of terrorist attacks, scams, social injustice, and allegations of misinformation. We simply do not know what or whom to trust. Individuals take a defensive stance to safeguard their own interests, as well as to protect themselves and their families from harm. In the last two decades, society has been trending towards self-centeredness. Reality television and social media sway the public towards narcissism and exhibitionism, rewarding the individual’s pride and vanity. Paul called these people of the end time “lovers of themselves” and “lovers of money” (2 Tim 3:2). Though such extreme behavior is rare in the church, an insidious sense of apathy towards the needs of others and the common good of the community can creep into the congregation. This is one of the greatest dangers in the end time—the growing apathy and disinterest towards our brethren. Some members are only interested in their own matters, doing the bare minimum for the church and leaving the “heavy lifting” to the ministers and church board members. Self-centeredness is the complete opposite to Jesus’ nature. He took the form of a bondservant, the likeness of man, humbling Himself and becoming obedient to the point of death (Phil 2:7–9). He became poor so that we could become rich (2 Cor 8:9). We should emulate this self-sacrifice. We need to progress from being unlike Christ to “Christ-lite,” and, eventually, to Christ-like. Paul exhorted the Ephesian members to transition from merely learning about the theoretical aspects of being like Christ to actually becoming like Him, by putting on the new man in true righteousness and holiness (Eph 4:20–24). True righteousness is not accomplished through word alone, but also action. And even when we carry out acts of righteousness and love, we do not do it to gain admiration from others (1 Jn 3:18; Rom 12:9). God is love; hence, we should abide in His love (1 Jn 4:16). We imitate His love by loving our brethren and serving the church, both of which often require self-sacrifice (1 Jn 4:20–21). While doing such acts, we do not expect repayment; rather, we love and serve because Jesus did the same. If we manifest His love to others, then He is glorified (Mk 10:45; 1 Pet 4:8–11). The early apostolic church was blessed by God. He increased their number daily and gave them signs and wonders because they knew how to love, share and give (Acts 2:44–45). Today, we encounter many obstacles to our growth, but often, we set up our own roadblocks. We have insufficient manpower, insufficient funds for church buildings, and insufficient numbers of volunteers dedicating themselves to full-time ministry. These result from self-centeredness, because we care for ourselves and our families more than we do for the body of Christ. We need to learn from the early church’s spirit of offering, trusting that the Lord will provide and will multiply the seeds we sow and the fruits of our righteousness (2 Cor 9:10). A LACK OF PURITY The half-hearted efforts of God’s people did not produce a magnificent second temple (Hag 2:3). But God did not associate their failure with a lack of material resources; after all, gold and silver belong to Him. The disappointing outcome was a product of their uncleanness (Hag 2:13). As a result, fifty measures became twenty, and twenty became ten (Hag 2:16). Their effort was ineffective because they did not turn to God and set their heart on Him (Hag 2:17–18). We can clearly see how God responded to Israel’s uncleanness and half-heartedness. During those times, the Israelites suffered much loss. When the people turned from God, Moses warned them not to fight the Amalekites and the Canaanites because God was not with them. They did not listen and suffered defeat (Num 14:43, 45). Later, they would again be defeated by the men of Ai because of the sin of one person, Achan (Josh 7:5, 11–13). When a church is not progressing, her members should reflect on why that might be. The church could be lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, like the church in Laodicea. God described the Laodiceans as poor, blind and naked (Rev 3:16–17): poor because they were spiritually impoverished; blind because they could not see their faults (Rev 3:18); and naked because they lacked good deeds and righteousness (Rev 16:15; 19:8). The prosperity of a church does not depend on her material wealth and the grandeur of the building, but on her spiritual vitality. A spiritually vibrant church is able to project her faith within her four walls and beyond, serving as an example for others to follow (1 Thess 1:8). The three greatest Christian attributes are faith, love, and hope (1 Cor 13:13); and these intangible attributes are manifested in the form of work, labor, and patience (1 Thess 1:3). The author of Hebrews exhorts the believers to regain their spiritual vitality and “strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees” (Heb 12:12–13). The way to do this is to pursue holiness (Heb 12:14). God is holy, so He expects His people to be holy (1 Pet 1:15–17); but when His children are stiff-necked and corrupt, He will not dwell with them, lest He consume them (Ex 33:3–5; 32:7–9). To become holy, we need to control our minds and be obedient (1 Pet 1:13–14). He who sanctifies himself will be considered a “vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work” (2 Tim 2:20–21). A sanctified church will be blessed with God’s abidance and power, which bring forth fruits of righteousness, to the glory and praise of God (Phil 1:11). HOW CAN WE BECOME A GLORIOUS CHURCH? When we reflect on our spiritual state and that of the church, it can seem a long way off from the glorious latter temple that God foresaw. We want to dedicate our life to God, but we are easily distracted. We want to believe, but our faith is insufficient. We want to love, but we only love those who love us (Mt 5:46). We proclaim that we uphold the truth, but we tread the same path as the Jews, who prided themselves on knowing the Law but failed to instruct themselves in it (Rom 2:20–24). Love, hope, faith and purity are the key building blocks of our belief. But the greatest danger for believers today is not practicing what they preach, and know, to be the truth. Belief is tainted with disbelief (Mk 9:24), actions are inhibited by procrastination, and our desire to draw near to God is hindered by our love of this world (Mt 13:22). We need to overcome this inertia by not just knowing or doing God’s will, but by transforming and renewing our minds (Rom 12:2). Knowing the truth is important, but we focus more on knowledge at the expense of action. Doing good is important, but we do it inconsistently, sometimes reluctantly. This attitude can only get us so far. The Bible prophesied that in God’s holy mountain, the church, there would be no pain. The wolf, bear, lion and leopard will become harmless—not because they are tamed, but because they are transformed (Isa 11:6–10). In the same vein, Paul exhorts the believers to be renewed in spirit, to put off the old man and put on the new man created in righteousness and true holiness (Eph 4:22–24). But where do we get the motivation to transform? We are motivated by God’s love. Paul was deeply touched by God’s love, as he viewed Christ’s death from a personal perspective: “[Christ] loved me and gave Himself for me” (Gal 2:20). Again, he writes: For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. (2 Cor 5:14–15) Paul’s love for God is demonstrated by his “earnest desire” and “groan[ing]” to be with Christ (Phil 1:23; 2 Cor 5:2; Rom 8:23). We need to have this same desire in order to be transformed by the love of Christ. Can we experience the same love that transformed Paul? Absolutely! God has given us His Holy Spirit, the same Spirit who transformed Paul. By this Spirit, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts (Rom 5:5). We simply need to open our hearts and allow God’s love to be poured in and to overflow. The Holy Spirit has not only allowed us to imbibe God’s love, but His transforming power has also set us free from sin (Rom 8:1–2). The word of God can sanctify us, but we need God’s power to carry out the word and to obey the truth by which our souls are purified (Jn 17:17; 1 Pet 1:22). With this transformation, God’s law is imprinted on our hearts and minds (Jer 31:33). With our fleshly heart sensitive to God’s love, we will be saved from defilement (Ezek 36:26–27, 29). If we fulfill His goodness and the work of faith with power (2 Thess 1:11–12), practicing brotherly love with purity and sincerity, then Jesus will be glorified in us, and us in Him. CONCLUSION When the first temple was completed, God made His presence felt by filling the temple with His glory (1 Kgs 8:11). In the apostolic church, God’s glory was manifested inwardly in the unity of the believers, their fellowship, gladness, simplicity of heart, and their steadfast adherence to the apostles’ teachings. Outwardly, God’s glory was manifested in selfless sacrifice, signs and miracles, praises to God, and the steady increase of believers (Acts 2:40–47). When many accept the grace of the gospel, their thanksgiving abounds to the glory of God (2 Cor 4:15). If we wish to see Haggai’s prophecy realized, then we need to have the same conviction as Paul, who, quoting Psalm 116:10, writes: “I believed and therefore I spoke” (2 Cor 4:13). The early church flourished not because the members were eloquent or well-versed in the Scriptures, but because they played their part in propagating the gospel. Ordinary believers took the initiative to spread the word without waiting for instruction. They took up the ministry to preach to the Greeks and the hand of God was with them, bringing many to believe (Acts 11:19–21). Their devotion, obedience, liberal sharing and selfless service did not go unnoticed, so God was glorified in all things (Acts 2:46; 2 Cor 9:13; 1 Pet 4:11). Jesus promised His believers that they would go on to do greater works than He has done (Jn 14:12). The prophecy of the Bible is not a futile hope; the glory of the latter temple will surely surpass that of the first temple, but only when we revive the zeal for God’s coming. We should “groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting” for it, with perseverance (Rom 8:23, 25). With this renewed focus and transformed mind and heart, we shall willingly dedicate our life to God (Rom 12:1–2). If we can lead this holy and selfless life, steadfast in the teaching of the Bible, God will manifest His glory in our life and in the church."
1,37085,Where Do We Go From Here?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2018/m85-11_ex_sg_aqchin_where do we go from here_5_37085.htm,"Publication Title Adapted from a sermon by Aun Quek Chin—Singapore The year 2017 was the centenary of the True Jesus Church. In 1917, through the downpour of the Holy Spirit, God established the True Jesus Church in China. Very quickly, the gospel was preached throughout China, as well as to Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries. Today, though the growth and development of our churches vary from country to country, we are thankful that the True Jesus Church is now planted in more than sixty-five countries across six continents. We firmly believe that despite the obstructions and difficulties we face, God will guide us through the stormy waters and give us victory at the end. THE NEXT STEPS Although we know it is God’s will for the True Jesus Church to be victorious, it is our duty to self-reflect and consider how we should proceed as a church beyond our centenary. Which direction should we move towards? Which way is the right way? How do we break through all these challenges in our path? How do we renew ourselves and rejuvenate our faith? Here are five things we should do that will serve us well in our journey as a church, until we reach our destination. Keep to the Old Ways Some members may think that the church should change with the times. They observe that other churches are always teaching new messages and revising their stances on topical issues in order to stay relevant, whereas we in the True Jesus Church seem stuck in our old ways. In this age, it is indeed not a bad thing to be creative and innovative. In various fields, such as industry and education, society is pushing for new and better ways of thinking and doing things. In a church setting, we could adopt this approach by delivering sermons in a more engaging way, ensuring the message is relevant to members living in this modern age. But this mindset of innovation should only go so far. Let us examine what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: Thus says the LORD: “ Stand in the ways and see, And ask for the old paths, where the good way is, And walk in it; Then you will find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’ Also, I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘ Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But they said, ‘We will not listen.’ Therefore hear, you nations, And know, O congregation, what is among them. Hear, O earth! Behold, I will certainly bring calamity on this people— The fruit of their thoughts, Because they have not heeded My words Nor My law, but rejected it."" (Jer 6:16–19) Though people nowadays desire novelty and new ideas, God instructs His people to ask for the old paths, where the good way is. How do we know that the old path is truly the good way? Because our predecessors and the saints walked it before us and emerged victorious. Abraham is a prime example; he and his descendants believed in God’s word and walked in the tried and tested paths, according to God’s commands. In the end, God fulfilled His promise to Abraham, bringing his descendants out of Egypt and into Canaan as a great nation. God’s promises have never, and will never, change. If we follow in the footsteps of the saints, we will see these promises unfold as they did in times past. The question is, can we hold fast to the old paths? In today’s context, to what do the old paths refer? They refer to the truth that was once and for all committed to the saints by the Lord Jesus; the truth comprises His teachings and the ways of the apostles that have been clearly recorded in the Bible. As the world changes, so will our approach and methods within church work. For example, the church has made leaps and bounds using the internet ministry for evangelism and pastoral purposes. However, those who seek novel concepts and new biblical interpretations may have already started upon a new path; on closer examination of their beliefs, they may have already strayed far away from the one true God. Even after one hundred years, we must keep to the old paths that our predecessors walked. Learn from the Acts of the Apostles How do we know in which direction the church should proceed? We must use the Acts of the Apostles, also known as the Acts of the Church, as our compass. The focus of Acts is not on the apostles’ endeavors; rather, from the first chapter to the last, the book focuses on the establishment and development of the church. ""The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God."" (Acts 1:1–3) Luke begins the Book of Acts by recounting how, for forty days, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples and spoke about the kingdom of God. He ends his account with Paul “preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him” (Acts 28:31). At this point, Paul was under house arrest in Rome, with a soldier for protection. Yet, miraculously, he was allowed to receive guests in his rented house, and thus continue the work of preaching. Roman law permitted such an arrangement, so Paul’s opponents could not hinder him from spreading the gospel. Through these amazing circumstances, the church in Rome was established. Though the worker of God was bound in chains, the word of God could never be bound; this is the conclusion that the Acts of the Apostles imprints on our minds. An entire book concerning the church of God was written so that we in this current generation can understand how the church was formed, and how she progressed despite tribulation. The church was challenged by heresies creeping in, members turning apostate, and persecution from all sides. But reading this history, one lesson is clear for the church today: we need not worry; the Holy Spirit Himself will comfort us and help us to flourish. All we must do is rely wholeheartedly on His guidance. Hold Fast to Pure Teachings There is an important question we should consider. Can the church today continue to hold fast to the pure teachings and the truth originally preached? The stance of the True Jesus Church has always been that we must be completely aligned with the Bible; we should seek to follow the blueprint of the early apostolic church—the image of the ideal church—as presented in the Book of Acts. Today, some may argue that times have changed and the apostolic church is an outdated model. Indeed, methods of church administration will necessarily adapt to changing times, but the founding principles of the apostolic church remain timeless. The truth preached by the apostles cannot be altered by changing societal attitudes. After all, the apostles did not invent this truth, so it is not a product of their era. The apostles’ message is the faith that was once for all committed to them by the Lord Jesus; it is the unchanging truth that remains relevant throughout the ages. The instruction of Jesus in Matthew 28:20, “[teach] them to observe all things which I have commanded you—and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of age,” was not just directed to the disciples of that time, but also to all future believers. If we are indeed believers of Christ and of the true church, then we should follow the instructions of the Lord Jesus as the apostles did. We should emulate the apostles, who sacrificed their all for the word of God and contended earnestly for the faith. When opposed by the rulers and elders of Israel, they boldly declared: “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:19b–20). In addition, they were very faithful in teaching the word of God, devoting themselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word (Acts 6:4). Finally, they were willing to suffer for His ministry. Enduring physical violence, imprisonment, and the threat of death, they did not waver in their faith and held fast to Jesus’ teachings. Today, in which direction should the church proceed? All we must do is follow in the direction set by the Acts of the Apostles. Be Led by the Holy Spirit The Acts of the Apostles is also known as the Acts of the Holy Spirit because it records how the Holy Spirit personally led the church. In Acts 2, we read how the Holy Spirit pricked the hearts of the Jews listening to Peter’s message, resulting in the baptism of about three thousand people. In Acts 3, because the Holy Spirit worked through Peter and John to heal a lame beggar, more than five thousand came to believe. This was how the church in Jerusalem was established. Some wonder how the apostolic church could have flourished with just twelve apostles and seven deacons. Even by the standards of the time, they were not a very talented bunch; yet, because they were faithful to God, the Holy Spirit worked mightily through them. Though the ability to speak is necessary, the presence of the Holy Spirit is even more essential if the workers are to touch the hearts of listeners. Before the events recorded in Acts 10, the Jews had been unable to accept that Gentiles could become the children of Abraham and receive God’s inheritance. The apostles understood, theoretically, that they were Abraham’s children not through circumcision but through belief in Jesus and baptism. But they did not have the courage to confirm their belief through action and bring the message to the Gentiles. However, in Acts 10, the Holy Spirit led a breakthrough by inspiring Peter to go to the house of Cornelius, a God-fearing Gentile. Peter himself was still doubtful, but as he preached to Cornelius and his family, he was reassured when God bestowed the Holy Spirit upon the Gentile listeners. Later, when Peter was criticized for having gone to Cornelius' house, he testified that these Gentiles had received the same gift that they had at the beginning: they spoke in tongues. There was no way Peter could prevent them from being baptized. If it were not for the work of the Holy Spirit, how could there have been such a breakthrough? How could Peter have persuaded the stubborn Jews to open the door for the Gentiles? Today, many doors are difficult to open. One of the toughest doors to open is the hearts of men. Some open their hearts and then shut them again. They repent, then return to sin. They believe and then they leave. Though these are hard doors to pry open, we can only do our best to preach the gospel, and the Holy Spirit will lead us in our efforts. Acts 15 records an incident of another nature—one concerning the truth. Some Jewish believers still insisted on circumcising Gentile believers, causing a divide in the apostolic church. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, this problem was given a final resolution (Acts 15:28–29). The church today will likewise be required to handle tricky questions and dilemmas when it comes to practicing the truth. When such situations occur, we must learn from the example of the incident in Acts 15 and wholly rely on the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Treat Prayer as a Service Last but not least, in order for us to progress after our centenary, let us not be ambivalent towards prayer. Some of us may be ill or elderly and unable to do much church work, but at the very least, we can pray. Then there are those who do much church work, but do not consider prayers to be a form of service. Paul emphasized the importance of supporting the workers through prayer, noting to the Corinthians: [You also helped] together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift granted to us through many. (2 Cor 1:11) How can we help the church and aid the church workers? Apart from offering our services and strength, we must also offer our prayers. When we pray with all our heart, it represents our total reliance on God’s guidance in the development of the church. Prayer can be accomplished by any believer and is a service we must not neglect. CONCLUSION God has led us thus far over the past century, and will continue to do so in the next if we play our part well. While having faith that God will cause His church to flourish, we must continue to walk in the old paths of the saints and rely on the guidance of the Holy Spirit. More importantly, we should pray that God preserves our own faith, so that we, as individuals, will not waver in our beliefs and can lead future generations to hold fast to the truth. The Holy Spirit will assuredly complete His work of perfecting the true church."
1,37492,Are We the Final Restoration?,https://elibrary.tjc.org/content/cm/EN/article/2018/m86_03th_sg_pshee_are we the final restoration_4_37492.htm,"Untitled Page Peter Shee—Singapore The Bible is about God and His covenant people, whom He had chosen from before the foundation of the world (Deut 7:6–9; Eph 1:4) and who will enjoy everlasting fellowship with Him in the new heavens and the new earth (Isa 65:17–18; 66:22). This is more than a return to Eden, in that our bodies will be transformed through God’s redemptive program, and death utterly defeated by resurrection. The original creation, with the son of God created out of dust, is finally and permanently restored. Israel and the Church Israel was the Old Testament elect. The church—comprising Jews and Gentiles—is the New Testament elect. God’s eternal purpose—our election in Christ (Eph 3:11; 1:4–11)—unravels in time and space through Abraham and his seed (Gen 12:7; 13:15; 24:7). The repeated use of the singular “seed” in the Genesis narrative is explained by Paul as a reference to Christ, in whom we receive the status of co-heirs (Gal 3:16, 29; Rom 8:17). The story of Israel, and God dwelling among them, is thus a pattern for the church. This is further attested by the allusion to Isaac and Jerusalem (Gal 3:22–28). The exodus from Egypt resulted in the birth of Israel as a nation, with God dwelling in their midst (Ex 25:8; 29:45–46; Lev 26:11–12). The divine Presence in the tabernacle was evident throughout the wilderness journey and later in Solomon’s temple (Ex 40:34–38; 1 Kgs 8:10–11). Likewise, the church as the “dwelling place of God in the Spirit” (Eph 2:22) is filled with glory. We then see a progression in the way God dwells among His people—from a physical sacred space in the tabernacle within the camp, to a physical temple within the city of Jerusalem, and finally, under the new covenant, God dwells directly within the redeemed human community itself. This is described by Peter as a “spiritual house” built up with “living stones” (1 Pet 2:5). The chosen people in the Old Testament were known as the “assembly [qahal, Hebrew] of God” (Neh 13:1; Deut 23:3). The Hebrew qahal for “assembly” is conceptually identified with the Greek ekklesia, translated as “church” in the New Testament. Hence, when Jesus establishes a new covenant with us, He re-organizes a new assembly of the chosen, comprising both Jews and Gentiles (Eph 2: 11–18; 3:6, 10), which He calls “My church” (Mt 16:18). The Church’s One Foundation God’s church in the New Testament is founded on the works of Jesus Christ and apostolic teaching. Towards the end of the apostolic era, sectors of the church were only alive in name but were in fact dead, and others were ready to die (see Rev 3:1–2). The post-apostolic church went through considerable syncretization. Simple home gatherings centered on prayer and the Scriptures (Acts 2:42) gradually morphed into elaborate liturgies with incense, candles and even images. Daily prayers in the temple (Acts 2:46–47) were replaced with daily rituals in buildings filled with icons and statues. Baptism in natural living water was brought indoors and embellished with ritual; with this deviation from scriptural prescription, the sacred ordinance became divested of the efficacy of Christ’s blood brought about by the Holy Spirit. Receiving the Holy Spirit evidenced by glossolalia—speaking in tongues—was substituted with ritual conferment of the Spirit through the imposition of hands by bishop or priest. But revival would certainly take place, for Jesus Himself declared that “the gates of Hades shall not prevail” against the church founded on solid rock (Mt 16:18). The solid foundation, the works of Jesus Christ completed in His lifetime and enshrined in apostolic teaching, was fully laid during the apostolic era (Eph 2:20). Thankfully, the form of doctrine, the pattern of sound words (Rom 6:17; 2 Tim 1:13), has been perfectly preserved in the canon of the Scriptures, comprising the Old and New Testaments. The apostle Peter attests that apostolic doctrine, or the New Testament, is built upon the Old Testament, and is in fact the sole interpretive authority for the Old Testament. This is because Jesus, as the beloved Son who came to fulfill Old Testament Scriptures, speaks with final authority (2 Pet 1:16–21; 1 Cor 15:1–4; Heb 1:1–2). Since the foundation of the church is Christ’s fulfillment of the Old Testament Scriptures, revival does not involve laying the foundation all over again. Nothing needs to be added to Christ’s work or to the Bible, and the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude 3) can be rediscovered within the pages of the Holy Writ. We just have to build on the existing foundation. The church is revived once we return to the Bible, specifically to the gospel that accords with apostolic doctrine in its fullness. Baptism in Jesus’ name, as preached by the apostles, traces its roots to the Old Testament ablutions and makes the important link to real effective cleansing based on the Old Testament concept of atoning blood (Heb 6:1–2; 10:19–22). With the return to efficacious biblical baptism comes the promise of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38); thus, members of the revived apostolic church only need to ask in faith to receive the Holy Spirit, with tongue-speaking as evidence. The Temple and the Church God’s church—typified by the latter temple—is built over two stages: foundation-laying during the apostolic era, and revival in the present era. Intrinsic to our affirmation that we are the revived true church is that we are the final restoration, leading to the consummation of all things. But how can we be assured of this? Understanding biblical prophecy is the key to discerning the times. Interestingly, in Matthew Chapter 16, Jesus mentioned the signs of the times and the sign of Jonah just before talking about building His church (Mt 16:2–4). He then moved on to announce His death and resurrection (Mt 16:21) as well as His kingdom (Mt 16:28, 19). Clearly, the sign of Jonah is the sign of His resurrection, the most important milestone in God’s restoration of Israel. The resurrected body of Christ is identified with the church as a body of believers resurrected in Christ through baptism (Eph 1:20–2:1; Col 2:12). The unmistakable link between the temple and the church, uttered by Jesus Himself (Jn 2:19–22), was well understood by New Testament writers (Eph 2:19–21; 1 Cor 3:6; 2 Cor 6:16; Rev 21:2, 10, 22). They saw the church in their era as the real temple, fulfilling the shadows of Old Testament temple rites (Heb 8–10) as well as exilic and post-exilic prophecies about God dwelling with His people (2 Cor 6:16; Ezek 37:27–28; Zech 8:8–9). Since the body of Christ is the real temple made without hands, it will last till the end of time; it will not be destroyed and there should be no need for rebuilding. As explained earlier, despite the downward spiral of the post-apostolic church, the dark ages of apostasy, and the current fragmentation of denominations, the foundation remained intact. The finished work of Jesus Christ cannot be undone, and the Bible has perfectly preserved the apostolic exposition of salvation by the cross. Exilic and post-exilic prophets projected into the distant future in their prophecies surrounding the second temple. Careful study in this regard gives us a clear picture of how the True Jesus Church fits in. “ I will shake heaven and earth…I will shake all nations…and I will fill this temple with glory. …The glory of this latter temple shall be greater than the former.” (Hag 2:6–9) This prophecy does not refer to the temple Zerubbabel built, but to a future temple built with living stones—in other words, the church of Jesus Christ to whom salvation came (1 Pet 1:10–12; 2:5), whose foundation was laid during the apostolic age (1 Cor 3:10–11; Eph 2:20). The fact that the apostolic project did not promptly result in a worldwide spread of the gospel and the destruction of Gentile kingdoms (Hag 2:20–22; Zech 14:8–9,17–19) is no reason to doubt that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed commissioned by God, whose disciples constitute the eternal temple to which all Gentiles will turn (Acts 5:38–39). The Jews stumbled at a crucified Messiah, because they did not understand that He shall come a second time in glory. Thus, we should learn to recognize the two stages in the construction of the church: the foundation-laying stage during the apostolic age, and the revival stage in our times. Only at the end of revival will the church have greater glory than Solomon’s temple—when she shall be adorned for her husband, reflecting the very glory of God (Rev 21:2, 10–11). Since death could not restrain the crucified Christ (Acts 2:24), the church would certainly be revived in time, even though she seemed to have descended into abysmal doom after the apostolic age. Zerubbabel and Temple-Rebuilding Zerubbabel eventually completed the second temple, despite some temporary disruption. In the same way, Jesus Christ, who raised the True Jesus Church as the revived apostolic church, will surely bring the restoration to its completion. As the temple-rebuilding was used prophetically to refer to the church being the final dwelling place of God, we must pay attention to the key figure, Zerubbabel, who led the delegation of rebuilders to Jerusalem for this great task (Ezra 2:2; 3:8). Of Davidic descent, he was made governor of Judah (Hag 2:2; Mt 1:1, 12). Concerning Zerubbabel, the word of the Lord came to Haggai, saying: “I will take you, Zerubbabel My servant, the son of Shealtiel…and will make you a signet ring; for I have chosen you” (Hag 2:23). This is of utmost significance, because Zerubbabel was a descendant of the second last king of Judah, of whom the Lord through Jeremiah declared: “ [T]hough Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on My right hand, yet I would pluck you off. … For none of his descendants shall prosper, Sitting on the throne of David, And ruling anymore in Judah.” (Jer 22:24, 30) Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, was never installed king over Judah. Hence, Haggai’s prophecy of the choice signet refers to a later fulfillment in the Messiah, whose virgin birth averted the curse upon Coniah. Hence, “the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end” (Lk 1:30–33). As for the temple, Zerubbabel’s hands were frustrated after the foundation was laid, and the work ceased for about fifteen years (Ezra 4:4–5, 23–24). Nevertheless, the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah brought about a revival and the rebuilding work resumed (Ezra 5:1–2). Likewise, throughout the worst of times encountered by the post-apostolic church, the foundation that was laid through the apostles was preserved in the Scriptures. And in God’s own time, He brought about a revival, with the True Jesus Church continuing to build upon the apostolic foundation. Therefore, the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel is especially applicable to us today: “ Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit… Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone With shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’ ” (Zech 4:6–7) Looking at the trajectory of the apostolic church’s rise and fall, some may wonder whether the True Jesus Church will also and eventually fall away from the truth. The answer is that we will not if we are truly the continuation of the work of the eschatological Zerubbabel—Jesus Christ—building on the very foundation He laid when He first established His church (Eph 2:20). Since the gospel of salvation we preach is the very “faith which was once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 3), then we can claim the Scripture saying: “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands shall also finish it” (Zech 4:9)!
