Who was, and is, and is to be, For aye the same!

The First, the Last: beyond all thought His timeless years!

Deep writ upon the human heart, On sea or land.

And spangled heav’ns, a shining frame, Their great Original proclaim.
Th’unwearied sun from day to day, Does his Creator’s power display,
And publishes to ev’ry land The work of an almighty hand.

Soon as the evening shades prevail, The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
And nightly to the list’ning earth Repeats the story of her birth;
Whilst all the stars that round her burn, And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings as they roll, And spread the truth from pole to pole.

What though in solemn silence all Move round this dark terrestrial ball?
What though no real voice nor sound Amid their radiant orbs be found?
In reason’s ear they all rejoice, And utter forth a glorious voice,
Forever singing, as they shine, “The hand that made us is divine.”",第 6 首 - 頌主造化大功,"大哉，穹蒼，冥冥無疆！極目天象，舖張八方；

Hymn 22 - There Is a Fountain Dear,"There is a fountain dear,
With water sweet and clear.
Each day at morn I’m surely bless’d,
as by God’s stream I rest.
There, far from all life’s troubling ills,
with peaceful balm my soul He fills.

Jesus, the noblest friend,
Lovingly clasps my hands,
Each day with Him, so kind and sweet,
in earnest prayer I seek.
His words mean all the world to me,
like precious gold they’ll treasured be.

Armed with the Word of God,
Strong shall I ever be.
From evil’s might I’ll take no fright,
Thy Spirit strengthens me.
Thy Word is like a banner free,
that leads me on to heav’n and Thee.

Then face to face with Thee,
I see clear all my sins.
No secret thought lies unrevealed,
nor hidden sin concealed.
Refreshed and free I come to Thee,
Thou gentle man of Galilee.

Bless’d Jesus, may Thy Word
Fill me with life anew,
With prayerful heart I’ll worship Thee
and learn Thy ways to do.
And so through all my earthly days,
I’ll work for Thee and sing Thy praise.",第 22 首 - 讚美經訓,"我有寶貴泉源，其水最清、最甘，

Hymn 29 - The Ninety and Nine,"There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter of the fold,
But one was out on the hills away, Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare, 
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care,
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.

“Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine; Are they not enough for Thee?”
But the Shepherd made answer: “This of Mine Has wandered away from Me,
And although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep.”

But none of the ransomed ever knew How deep were the waters crossed;
Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed thro’ Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
Out in the desert He heard its cry,
Sick and helpless and ready to die;
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

“Lord, whence are those blood drops all the way That mark out the mountain’s track?” 
“They were shed for one who had gone astray Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.”
“Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?” 
“They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn;
They’re pierced tonight by many a thorn.”

And all thro’ the mountains thunder-riv’n, And up from the rocky steep,
There arose a glad cry to the gate of heav’n, “Rejoice! I have found My sheep!”
And the angels echoed around the throne, 
“Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!
Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!”",第 29 首 - 主尋亡羊,"一百隻羊有九十九，在主欄中安眠，但有一隻遠離真門，迷路諸山之間；
遠在荒山、深谷徘徊，遠離良牧照顧慈懷，遠離良牧照顧慈懷。

良牧已有九十九隻，難道還嫌不夠？良牧回答：「那隻迷羊，本來是我所有。
路徑雖然高低不平，曠野雖遠，我必去尋；曠野雖遠，我必去尋。」

得救之羊從未知道，路中山高、水深，不知長夜何等黑暗？尋羊何等艱辛？
曠野之中，良牧遙聞，迷羊失望垂死哀鳴，迷羊失望垂死哀鳴。

問主：「山徑沿途血跡，到底從何而來？」主說：「牧人必須流血，迷羊才得救回。」
問主：「雙手，為何傷裂？」主說：「因為路多荊棘。」主說：「因為路多荊棘。」

歷經雷霆霹靂之山，穿過危崖絕壁，良牧呼聲直達天門：「樂哉亡羊已得！」
圍繞寶座天使和唱：「樂哉！主已尋得亡羊！樂哉！主已尋得亡羊！」"
Hymn 30 - In Tenderness He Sought Me,"In tenderness He sought me, 
Weary and sick with sin,
And on His shoulders brought me 
Back to His fold again,
While angels in His presence sang 
Until the courts of heaven rang.

He washed the bleeding sin wounds
And poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me, 
“I’ve found thee, thou art Mine.”
I never heard a sweeter voice;
It made my aching heart rejoice!

He pointed to the nail prints,
For me His blood was shed;
A mocking crown so thorny
Was placed upon His head:
I wondered what He saw in me
To suffer such deep agony.

I’m sitting in His presence,
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace.
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.

So while the hours are passing,
All now is perfect rest;
I’m waiting for the morning,
The brightest and the best,
When He will call us to His side
To be with Him, His spotless Bride.

"Hymn 75 - In Israel, the Angel Did Say","In Israel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a dark, starry night that was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

And by the light of that same star
The wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
Who hath made heav’n and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.

And did my Sov’reign die?

For sinners such as I?

And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut his glories in,

For man the creature’s sin.

The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,

讓我蒙恩人來飽嘗，多虧祢在十架代死亡，耶穌！
甘願受咒詛掛木上；救贖我出死亡、脫罪孽，耶穌！

祢愛在我身永不缺。

我晝夜常羨慕祢的家，耶穌！
在天為聖徒預備好，黃金街、碧玉城，樂無涯，耶穌！
不再有痛苦與煩惱；得常在祢腳前享愛情，耶穌！
普世所有福難較量，祢的愛至永遠不變更，耶穌！
將來必使我得榮耀。

Hymn 92 - I Am Coming to the Cross,"I am coming to the cross;
I am poor and weak and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall full salvation find.

Long my heart has sighed for Thee;
Long has evil dwelt within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me, 
“I will cleanse you from all sin.”

Here I give my all to Thee;
Friends and time and earthly store;
Soul and body Thine to be,
Wholly Thine forevermore.

In the promises I trust;
Now I feel the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust;
I with Christ am crucified.

I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Dear Lamb of Calvary,
Humbly at the cross I bow;
Save me, Jesus, save me now.",第 92 首 - 病癒感恩,"哈利路亞，讚美神！

Hymn 93 - Sometimes a Light Surprises,"Sometimes a light surprises
The Christian while he sings,
It is the Lord who rises
With healing in His wings.
When comforts are declining
He grants the soul again,
A season of clear shining
To cheer it after rain.

In holy contemplation,
We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God’s salvation,
And find it ever new;
Set free from present sorrow,
We cheerfully can say –
E’en let th’unknown tomorrow
Bring with it what it may.

It can bring with it nothing
But He will bear us through;
Who gives the lilies clothing,
Will clothe His people too:
Beneath the spreading heavens
No creature but is fed;
And He who feeds the ravens
Will give His children bread.

Though vine nor fig tree neither
Their wonted fruit should bear;
Though all the fields should wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there:
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice;
For, while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice.",第 93 首 - 更新感恩,"歡喜快樂之良辰，因為去舊更新；

過去淒涼真可憐，今天富足、歡欣；

昨天心靈多沮喪，今得靈力振興；
昨天失敗齊堆集，今日勝利光臨。

Where the dear ones, gone before,
Sing Thy praise forever,
On that peaceful shore.

That saved a wretch like me!

I have already come; 
’Tis grace hath bro’t me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;

Hymn 97 - Ivory Palaces,"My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
With joy my being thrills.

His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start.

His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.

In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heav’nly home,
To dwell forevermore.

Save in the death of Christ my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,

"Hymn 110 - Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken","Jesus, I my cross have taken,
All to leave, and follow Thee;
Destitute, despised, forsaken,
Thou, from hence, my all shalt be;
Perish ev’ry fond ambition,
All I’ve sought or hoped or known;
Yet how rich is my condition:
God and heav’n are still my own!

Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Saviour, too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me,
Thou art not, like man, untrue;
And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate, and friends may shun me:
Show Thy face, and all is bright.

Man may trouble and distress me, 
’Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
Life with trials hard may press me,
Heav’n will bring me sweeter rest;
O ’tis not in grief to harm me,
While Thy love is left to me;
O ’twere not in joy to charm me,
Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

Haste thee on from grace to glory,
Armed by faith, and winged by prayer;
Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee,
God’s own hand shall guide thee there;
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days;
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
",第 110 首 - 撇物從主,"今我撇下凡百世物，甘背十架跟耶穌，
雖至貧寒多受委屈，心惟愛主做門徒；
任憑世界輕我、離我，救主也曾被棄侮，
但願全智、全能上主，慈愛待我永無殊。

世上名利任其失落，或遇凌辱，或遭害，
我惟事主憂則成樂，蒙主悅納窮即財；
友雖疏遠，敵雖怨謗，狂風、暴雨交迫來，
但我仰靠主愛、主恩，仍然平安笑顏開。

人雖向我騷擾、攻擊，卻是驅我到主前，
世界苦難越發壓迫，天上平安更覺甜；
但求我主待以恩愛，信德鍛鍊更貞堅，
萬般福氣若非主賜，焉能使我樂無邊？

須由恩中趨至榮耀，完全無罪、無懼憂，
永生盼望就在眼前，主必引領到盡頭；
靈戰獲勝，世路行完，公義冠冕為我留，
今所盼望將成實得，信則眼見，讚代求。"

Heal the sick and lame,
Cheer the mourner, calm the tempest

Seeks the lost one now;
Sinner, come, and at His footstool
Penitently bow;

Go, and sin no more,”
Speaks to Thee that word of pardon,
As in days of yore.

Never need’st thou fear;
He who came to faithless Thomas
All thy doubt will clear;
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest
Bids thee still, with love as tender,
Lean upon His breast.

Walked upon the sea
Still can hush our wildest tempest,
As on Galilee;
He who wept and prayed in anguish
In Gethsemane
Drinks with us each cup of trembling,
In our agony.

With them to abide,

Hasten, Lord, the day!

His truth to triumph through us:

For lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

No thanks to them, abideth;

Lift as from the heart of one!

Reigns in love forevermore.

Hymn 238 - Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne,"Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem’s home was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Heaven’s arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth didst Thou come to earth,
And in greatest humility.

The foxes found rest, and the birds their nests
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.

Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word,
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.

When the heavens shall ring, and its choirs shall sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home, saying, “Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee.”

惟我主耶穌順父旨奔波，在世間無枕首之所。

人卻戲笑主，加以荊棘冠，釘十架為極刑罪犯

In toil and pain and sin,
While cloistered hearts are longing
To bring the kingdom in,

Of proud and beaten men,
When they have found each other,
Thy kingdom will come then!

Hymn 274B - From Greenland’s Icy Mountains,"From Greenland’s icy mountains,
From India’s coral strand,
Where Afric’s sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand,
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error’s chain.

What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle;
Though ev’ry prospect pleases,
And only man is vile;
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strewn;
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone.

Shall we, whose souls are lighted,
With wisdom from on high,
Shall we to men benighted
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! O salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till earth’s remotest nation
Has learned Messiah’s name.

Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
And you ye waters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till o’er our ransomed nature
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign.",第 274 (乙) 首 - 福音要遍傳,"從格陵蘭冰雪山，至印度珊瑚岸，

Be saved, to sin no more:

Be saved, to sin no more.

Unworthy though I be,
For me a blood-bought, free reward,
A golden harp for me!

Take me, save me, thro’ Thy Son;
That which Thee wouldst have me, make me, 
Let Thy will in me be done.

Thorny proved the way I trod;
Weary come I now, and praying, 
Take me to Thy love, my God!

Humbly I confess my sin;
At Thy feet, O Father, falling,
To Thy household take me in.
Freely now to Thee I proffer
This relenting heart of mine;
Freely life and soul I offer,
Gift unworthy love like Thine.

Bore our sins upon the tree;

Lord of harvest, grant that we Wholesome grain and pure may be.

For the Lord our God shall come, And shall take His harvest home;
From His field shall purge away, All that doth offend that day;
Give His angels charge at last In the fire the tares to cast;
But the fruitful ears to store In His garner evermore.

Even so, Lord, quickly come, To Thy final harvest home;
Gather Thou Thy people in, Free from sorrow, free from sin,
There, forever purified, In Thy presence to abide;
Come, with all Thine angels, come, Raise the glorious harvest home.

See His footprints all the way.

Far beyond the starry sky;

I shall reign with Him on high.

Hymn 453 - A Child of the King,"My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.

My Father’s own Son, the Saviour of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His when He comes by and by.

I once was an outcast sinner on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth,
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.

A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing:

如今祂在天，為我求赦免；將來主再臨，我得歸屬耶穌。

今蒙主收納，名錄生命冊，作天父後嗣，承受華冕天庭。
